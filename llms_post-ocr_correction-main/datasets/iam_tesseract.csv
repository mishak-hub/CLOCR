a02-027.png,"The stores had been hit by the same strike wave that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past week. Root of the discontent: The austerity Budget, including a compul- sory savings scheme which the Ghana Government introduced in July. Ghana's strong man is not here to face the storm. President Nkrumah, having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference in Belgrade, has resumed his holiday on the Black Sea and no one here professes to know when he will return.","TL, tne, Bul teen Lift by Me reme hike were Lit Loy pouolyred the pot of Tord for the port wea, Lect ot the dirromntapt: Re rurtenty budsst, inebediny a Comprlony rercgs ere bh the Gbann Geremmrt reduced om tly.

a02-037.png,"The urge came from a conference of activists of Nkrumah's Convention Party ""after powerful addresses by Comrades Krobo Edusei, Tawia Adamafio,"" and others.

These stern measures had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the strikers gave in, but in Takoradi, the chief storm centre, they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400 police and 16 armoured cars.

Sir Roy, Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister, said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia National Congress, which was led by Mr. Kaunda until he was outlawed in 1959. The record of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went back a long way, Sir Roy told the Federal Parliament in Salisbury.","Ae peg W Lens aud bday bol be ns Len er aceepld the ood faith of M.

a03-006.png,"Today, for example, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav Foreign Minister. In fact such Yugoslav activity has been particularly intensified in the past year or so and though so far, apart from joint action in the United Nations, these exchanges have not been seen on any wider basis, President Tito is known for some time to have favoured a conference of neutralist leaders.","loday, for example, the irtign Mmsker of trolo- tila Urwth w belyravl ad fhe gues the fugeulac forage Aanisler.

a03-009.png,"The wish was particularly apparent in comments on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and, in particular, in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an inter-African consultative assembly which would coordinate activity on the political and economic sphere; and it is not difficult to see that President Tito would like some such idea extended also to the whole uncommitted world.","(he tedh whet jarticilay Gyletanp <0 commeth a” Me cay the cotene 0 Aedtltvian au th pallies, x» Viggorier gyroral of te wlan of a wiles Gytean corsilatire arsemlly sitiiih ncud, cola actiirly an he pililtcal av conor goer; aid dae riot dill te 20 Jha” fisili bile 20rd lie gare aah Hila celtaid al te Me jitite ancommilld cord "

a03-020.png,"Prince Souvanna's former Minister of Information, Mr. Quinim Pholsena, who claims to be his representative in Laos, yesterday addressed all officers of the pro-communist forces occupying the province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Sou- vanna's Government was the only legal one in the country.

Most of the province of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain of Jars, however, appear still to be firmly in their hands. The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng, the pro-communists' former base 60 miles north of Vientiane, but this claim had been made before the end of last month.","This enphacis on fhe legatity of the forme Gove-mmen!

With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica and his Cabinet out in the grass roots making 160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days, the Liberal Party are holding a national conference here with some 2,000 delegates, the biggest gathering since 1958 when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party leader.","A tontipor dat iho Tiaye led yastor dog ty with a fw wate of \auy Mey wor kel by dpicou thot cid vitloyo war Ql Nod by the 0 — oMIMLULSEC With the Rule tutor atuuei. rama fund Quod WA (above qué we the ou NOOCA yok AGO ApLeehor n fo andntulacr tn Ao doy tho Gibeal Pucy ne houlinp a noctional en ference howe with domk 4,000 dothrates, Che pipet aathoun Hh Adsy hon Mh.

Last September a public poll showed that for the first time since the Administration came to power in 1957 the Liberals were ahead (43 per cent were in favour of ""The Grits"" if a federal election had been held last autumn, 38 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F.).","QM four pxere Cousrvalive alronghotdle. trad teplembrer a puultic ppotl dhowtd thal for flu fargt Aime eqinee.

a03-043.png,"However, a separate poll revealed that Mr. Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of popularity as an individual leader (for Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent, for Mr. Pearson 34 per cent).

a03-047.png,"It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson in the role of a popular orator at the hustings, the spellbinder that Mr. Diefenbaker was in the last two campaigns. The impression remains that the Liberal leader is still the diplomatist, more at home in the chancery, or the corridors of the United Nations, not the father figure, so necessary in Canadian leadership, or the practical politician, able to talk about sewage problems in Algoma East.","lr us difficult {7 ety to te De.

a03-050.png,"On the other hand, Mr. Pearson excels in meeting people informally, but many still regard him ""as some sort of cross between an egghead and a missionary"".

a03-054.png,"Everything is being done to promote a new image. Certainly, he is now a much tougher character politically than when he took over the leadership. He was merci- lessly trounced by Mr. Diefenbaker in the House in those early days. It has been a hard road back but now, with plenty of political ammunition given him by the Gov- ernment in recent sessions, he is leading the Opposition with skill and assurance and is a match for the Prime Minister across the floor.","Cenes, WS nasal“ Aone ‘op growoke a news were.

a03-063.png,"Mr. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a European space satellite project, will find the Germans interested in the principle of space research, but rather sceptical about British plans for organizing it. Stated more bluntly, they are still unconvinced that this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to salve Blue Streak, which was abandoned last summer as a military project; or that the new European space satellite is indeed to be purely scientific in character.","Sentence Latabase.

a03-066.png,"Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to remove these doubts, and to persuade the Federal Government that the financial burden involved is really worth while, at a time when any increase in budgetary commitments would almost certainly involve a corresponding rise in taxation - something no one is prepared to contemplate in an election year.","Ur Thomeycroft's maw purpos2. will be 40 {@move those dou'ois / ANA 10 pessvode he Fedasa\ Government that tha financra\ burdor) INVElVe 18 Ieally wary While, at atime wen Ony NICOLA 1m budgetary CamrartmantsS woudl almost Costaunty WAN OQ Cor (es pondiry 192 In toxoher ~ sowating NO On 15 preparea\ to comannplat@ tn an elcton year.

a03-071.png,"But, at the same time, there is reason to believe that the Federal Government is not convinced, on the basis of the information it has so far, that such a project would be justified from a scientific point of view; and not merely constitute a ""prestige"" satellite, duplicating to some extent American efforts, as Die Welt suggests today in a highly critical editorial article.","oe whos DdCrana., Meiemecni , re a ak ul sow ko “Bwe , DeL2vuea wrarw Abs. footarat COA OAC N , own FeO Rsences.s ok Lan we Lowe adns.. “hw “OO oO Cus, hort anrcrw w Pray ok wWoulorK wa Qn from a ectt Cia potut ab vay; O~ cK uo» MADD R_ UA, CCKwsh Wal a y push go SAMA , Au puUCaAh. ¢ ko sounn_ gxlertk Mensa ca on erov'r | as “DO Wer su qesdro Lo clan, es ~A We GUY enweal whet, "
a03-073.png,"On the specific question of the use of Blue Streak, Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be easier. He can point out that this is the only rocket and launcher in Europe to have reached a sufficient stage of development for adaptation as the first stage in putting a heavy satellite into outer space. There has also been some talk of adopting another British rocket, Black Knight, for the second stage, but the French have one of their own called Veronique which they would like to see used.","Cr Bra spRrARC qerraidecn Gah MK 4?

a03-080.png,"The Foreign Ministry spokesman added today, however, that the Brussels Treaty was irrelevant, because research on the various rocket stages had already been concluded, and only cooperation on the type of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle to German participation is the absence of any Ministry or Minister directly responsible for it - and therefore of any budget under which funds could be appropriated.","“Tha, “For 24 ea Kurang 2polse wre aclal2zoN tothkon, KowRO@T, brow Ma Peuale ieee by WET reRlRvent » Gecorae. usec cn Wea Ocanonns voctah Shag. tack alvCacky &2an COA CACAREK rR CN CL COMPSIOOMeEL bis, bya OL cCapeutea_ Lome “UROL URON .

With the exception of 40 minutes when Lord Home, Foreign Secretary, and Mr. McGeorge Bundy, the President's special assistant for security affairs, were brought in, the two men talked alone.","Hz.

Labour M.P.s already have many questions to the Prime Minister asking for a statement. President Kennedy flew from London Airport last night to arrive in Washington this morning.

a04-023.png,"Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks, followed by lunch given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other guests present, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more times yesterday. In PARIS, Mr. Dean Rusk, U.S. Secretary of State, gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the 15-nation Nato council. Some of his listeners said he was ""rather pessimistic"" and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year.","Apart fou thet formal Aduirathy Mouse tables, jolbuseol by duel given by Lacly Doty Mlocwilla, wit Me.

""The Soviet Union has always striven and is striving to safeguard an enduring peace for the peoples, to secure an early solution of the disarmament problem, and to bring about a peaceful settlement of international disputes through negotiations,"" he said.","Sn Vienna , Adore 44 Ks, on fy Moscou, Ur. khiushckoy seaiot he br speck lis weekeuct talks with Cresidert Kennet, Lwuikt & help ‘ to eslabeish au oholu as poce Selueet nadie Replys p fo fre tcl rypeect frou Anusha Peesioct Schoer | fee Syuiel Pence thaukeor seshte for- thy hoseilehity anh jrelcomie be hat rKoelvreot, ""The Swuiel Uaioe hav alloc ge our, anol bs SU ee to safeguarl a4 outurlug peace for fe popes | A Secure G4 aay NK, bor of Ha "
a04-043.png,"MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded defence of the Polaris missile base. And by implication he supported the establishment of sites in Britain for the training of German troops. His main theme was that nuclear weapons were necessary to defend Britain, that Britain must depend on Nato and ""the West"" must have nuclear weapons so long as the Soviet Union has them.","Mr, far (5 kell bola y Achi yon a full Sboooet aefence of Ha Prfarls trissLe Sase, Aol 55 lin POA hou fhe Styy7or ka fhe eat slinenct of Ser Wt, BAleKkl Ar fice bau ey of ae hoops. thy par heme pas at ucclea- bx Copedrs bre hecessarG to Aft Brifera , Fad SH lake, tre pl Gl pcuk bu Wahy duo * fue lLioyl ™ feast hace uuclear LEC pos SY Couey as le Sv uiet fla ie. lay Meets.

a04-047.png,"Addressing the annual congress of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers, he said he felt sure the Labour movement was coming round in support of his views. Obviously conscious of the fierce and widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in Britain, Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on to the missile.","Addressing He annual compas of the Nehonel Union f Conse aud Tunicipel Maes, de ssid A fall Aun Ae [ghouw smovemeut wud Gaming own d uy Aupak of Kin views.

a04-050.png,"Mr. Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could not deny facilities to nations to which it was allied. But governments should be free to negotiate and refuse proposals with which they did not agree. The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles, because, he said, they were out of date and vulnerable and would attract enemy action.","Ha Gaskell pail Hat a pn of ew Mouw could pot cy facil he + mabous to uhh jf vows aed. 3d Govermnuneh Shab! be pu to meso be aud Aefiue poral vat stich Hy ddl mot cg Mee Libre Rely ape Tha mis Gs hue te asic, thay wen out of dae owe! uibnrche ou! woul! 2 hac tran acho | , "
a04-054.png,"That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine. So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons, the West, somewhere, must have them too. It was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory purposes to be under the sea rather than on land. This was why the Labour Party did not think it right to oppose the Polaris depot ship.","That oaumed Lic! not fey fo fhe Toborus submarine So ong as the Soviet Union hal yu clear tes pend, the Wet, Arnewhue must Aare Hom ho .

a04-059.png,"The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base in the Holy Loch, only 30 miles from Glasgow, a city with two million people. It should be sited in a more remote area. Mr. Gaitskell added that the Scarborough conference decisions did not, in his view, truly reflect the opinions of the majority of party members and still less the party's supporters in the country."," The forky apd Wad domo simerse ty Goats he bon Ae thy te Lach , only Bo mito fom Gloaga> , « oly wilh tour pr tlerw pH.

a04-066.png,"Mr. Gaitskell added that agreement with the unilateralists was not possible, though he respected their views. He saw by reports that ""those who organise these things"" were recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament to shift the emphasis of their intervention away from straight opposition to the official document on to opposition to the Polaris base.","1.

a04-069.png,"To Mr. Macmillan, Mr. Gaitskell said the Prime Minister should begin to take seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons within the Nato alliance. ""Let us say to Macmillan that he should press, I hope with the agreement of Kennedy, in talks with the Soviet Union, for the establishment in central Europe of a zone of controlled disarmament.""","Ts Oa.

a04-072.png,"He thought, he said, that the Soviet Union would be prepared to reach an agreement on a zone of controlled disarmament in Europe. Mr. Gaitskell concluded, declaring that the present was the beginning of a great period of opportunity for the party. It was a great chance that should be grasped. Inter-union jealousies prevent the fulfilment of a common policy for wages and other major questions, Mr. Jack Cooper, president, declared when congress opened.","we tot ) ly aed kl th.

a04-081.png,The General Council of the Trades Union Congress should therefore consider the matter. Consideration should also be given to the regrouping of unions and the modification of their structures to meet the growing concentration of capital.

a04-085.png,"Suggesting that a total T.U.C. membership of eight million was a ""poor show"" com- pared with some countries, he argued that the position needed examination. BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr. Macmillan yesterday morning he was given the views of a wide section of the British people about Polaris submarine bases in this country. An open letter written by Earl Russell hoping that the President's visit to London ""will prove fruitful"" was handed in at the American Embassy by representatives of the Committee of 100.","Suggesting ral a tolal TU. membership of eighk willion was a peor show ' compaved with some covnlvies , he avqued thal the position needed examination, ISEFORE Presiclrl Kennedy mel Wr.

a04-089.png,"Earl Russell, President of the Committee of 100, told Kennedy that he should take notice of ""that very large and growing section which is opposed to the establishment of a Polaris base, whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on British territory."" He pointed out that already there have been protests but that ""very much larger protests are to be expected and are being planned.""","Earl uscell .

a04-092.png,"There are three kinds of reasons that justify the protests and these should carry weight with the U.S. Government, Earl Russell suggested. ""The first of these reasons is the importance of preserving the hitherto cordial relations between the U.S. and Great Britain, not only in Government circles, but in public opinion."" Earl Russell says it is inevitable, though profoundly regrettable, that the agitation against the Polaris base has generated some antagonism to the policy of the United States.","There ave three kinds of veasons that postify the protests ard These shold Carry weiglt with The US.

"
a04-096.png,"The second reason is concerned with doubts as to the safety of the people of Great Britain; ""in a time of crisis it would probably be impossible for the British authorities to exercise any degree of control over the action of Polaris submarines."" He argues that there is a distinct possibility that so long as there is a Polaris base in Britain the Soviet Union might retaliate against Britain alone.","The second veason js Concerned with cloubts as to the satehy of the people of Great Brite . “yn the time of crisis i# world probably be Jrapossi ble for the British authorities to exercise any deyree of control over the action of Polaris scbmarnes,” He argues that There isa dishnet possibility that so long as there 15a Polans base jn Britany the Co cen might yetalate against British alon .

a04-099.png,"""Such retaliation might, and probably would, destroy the whole population of Britain in the course of, at the most, an hour"" without provoking American retaliation. Earl Russell believes: ""It is very questionable whether British membership of Nato and British permission of American bases on our territory add anything to the strength of America, while, on the contrary, they impose upon America an onerous obligation which it may prove impossible to fulfil.""","“Such vetahaton might, and probabl, wold, Clestroy the whole population of Britain 15 the course of atthe most an hour ~ without Provoline American retahation.

a05-000.png,"THE next White Paper on defence, to be published in March, is likely to contain a five-year plan for the three Services. Its aim will be to produce superbly equipped, all-Regular forces of about 400,000 men. The three Services would be ""integrated"" to a greater extent than ever before.","Suc uss WOU ta” Fa pas on oagle <a, tbo Be pu ssak Le Marea, | oe Khai to Cenc. aw Wom ~ \Ros- plar ben ear breor Raxeicae .

a05-004.png,"Short of wearing the same uniform, which is not contemplated, the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force would become, for practical purposes, a single defence force. There would be complete co-operation at all levels in training and operations. This would apply also in the command structure and central administrative organisation. Mr. Watkinson, Minister of Defence, has been working on the plan for some months, with the Prime Minister's approval.","Short of wearing the sQme UWuform, which 1s not contenploded , the Navy , haves Quad Royal Aw Torae would Kecome , For prachcal Purposes , O sng le Alefence Yorce.

a05-013.png,"The scheme will be subject to Cabinet approval. Mr. Watkinson remains convinced that the policy initiated in 1957, in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister of Defence, is still correct. This was to return to the tradition of all-Regular voluntary forces, with the last National Serviceman out of uniform by the end of 1962.","i daketonta - we aD lo Ca®iuok AP CYOVEA | oe BAA dee Gee oe = Acard Mead Lbs. poor ee pe ee ARSE, LR Me.

a05-017.png,"The Minister regards the recent trend of recruiting figures as encouraging. He is confident the aim can be achieved. While the possibility of an eventual return to National Service in some form cannot be entirely discounted, he does not agree that the point has been reached where this need even be considered. If National Service is ever resorted to, engagement would probably have to be for three years.","TPN kee merce Mia stank be a “Ace us 4 ae Oe WCAunrQAQn~sc. a. oe Cen etek te ee Cm OE CU LOLA ML peattletthy of a cocrdual walera Vo ADaMenral Seusita § we seen. © eiecseons Conoco BQ CLR Q MoccurtedK , 42 Are woh aquea Mak Us pewk tag Dean wacrsnr wR Mi, used Wwe. 2 comscrmanr. if NeXnoit Laoie .

a05-022.png,"It is thought this would be the minimum necessary for the extended training modern arms require and to enable each man to serve at least a year overseas. There is no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson is at odds with the Service chiefs over the decision to dispense with National Service, or over any other aspect of defence policy.","% ite beau gh bras wo omalol Qa Las CR wLereenry for Lan @ wn cASLON heen %, Wocis ny, CAT ™ Mm, PR CEAIN An WN ho ena QACwsA wn CA ko Tes as aepoen_ avd oo QA QQam powcTsace, wd ’ oa odds wo.

a05-025.png,"Criticisms about Army manpower appear to have come mainly from retired officers who have held high positions but are out of touch with the existing situation. Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing, who believes completely in the principle of an all-Regular army. Gen. Sir Richard Hull, who is to succeed Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr. Watkinson is right.","Cw WA s wre aKjyout wry WACMWAQMDNU™” = ABERreC ko Kaeo CoH marun ly Wor varack othcan wo UAavde WX LA i pewreree pos Hen, Our men. own Cb Fomckn cochlea bee) Gun sinmety as bntablinde : Mer.

Mr. Watkinson and his advisers felt the change would be unwise at a moment when attention had to be concentrated on possible need for important military operations. For this reason Sir Francis stayed on, and sacrificed his leave.","Go “Pewwck. & to Mew «6Ofoter he) 8 | Dawe ows fox Noo. A.

a05-039.png,"There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd, the Prime Minister. This implies the disappearance of the Progressive party from the House. Early results in yesterday's general election showed Nationalists being returned in their strongholds, like Bloemfontein and the Transvaal, with slightly increased majorities. In the Cape, the veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was defeated in his constituency, Salt River, by the United party candidate, Mr. H. M.

a05-048.png,Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was evident that voters were bored by the Government's frequent appeals to the electorate. The election was the fourth in four years. In most constituencies it may go down as the most apathetic in the country's history. THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons last night that he had con- sidered early in the Parliamentary recess whether to mobilise reserves necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing.,"ve WO long Geld poOURY cl\carck of P win. arark bro yoQr hoe bow by bw Gores warts fagusk appeorte fo bo etechware | Tg hie. wee Wer Cork. cn Seer pee.

a05-053.png,"He decided that it would be a great error to do so and to recall Parliament. But there would be no hesitation in mobilising if a further deterioration in the situation warranted such a step. It would have to be accompanied by other measures of a military, economic and political kind. Mr. Macmillan, who was winding up the foreign affairs debate, said the Government could not be party to accepting as a matter of principle the imposed division of Germany.","We ORcrasck brah F WauwlrA ba a cero Qwvane lo Ao 209 anicrK to «scaly Fee “Buk oe Went Ex ue Wiertods 6 mai sug AN w~w bLieilos crabarcadiL Lens wi sient, Warvaniad arctra Arca, Lk woul Laver to 02 OH COOP SN my ChAT Heron, ot im. wr bow [RCO A, & RON cae Sescnsine tll bor.

a05-062.png,"With a vigour and authority which delighted old Parliamentary friends and foes alike, the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony Eden, in his maiden speech in the House of Lords last night, gave a warning that appeasement over Berlin could only lead to war.

a05-069.png,"It was the end of a rather curious speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up the two-day debate on foreign affairs. He began in a low, almost chatty monotone, and his voice never rose to any accent of urgency. He passed in rapid review the United Nations Secretariat; nuclear tests; the canard about British interference with the United Nations in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East Asia.","Ve woes Mint ae ob Aa obs. conte PAC ie WRK MW Macular, Would uy Ws DO - Ao ABAD cn favarqu afhan.

""We do not,"" he said, ""really know what the Russians want."" But he was certain that they wanted to establish a final and irrevocable division of Germany. Britain could not be a party to an imposed division. But negotiation, as the debate had shown, could be undertaken on a variety of bases.","Ho, Spa> wate ® Oh Vic shart wath-howr an Bast Me pl RH be pron BIULL of PONS URED may be * ohark Rebayal ab Sermawy Ha, tne, Alms. .

a05-080.png,"Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliberately refrained during the summer from recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation by proclamation, such as would be nec- essary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a fully active footing.

a05-084.png,"The Russians now realised its seriousness. The French doubts were more about pro- cedure than about substance. The Prime Minister's attitude of studied calm brought down the temperature of the debate, which never at any time rose to fever pitch, to a remarkable degree of sub-normality. Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl of Home, Foreign Secretary, was listening in the Peers' Gallery.","oe Ge a es ee Ths, “Ayan crn Aaui®wlo WEAR wWower_ aba it prac awe rcnr aborurk rnitlolerce .

We started with the plaintive wailings of Mr. Healey, ""Shadow"" Foreign Secretary, described by Mr. Godber, Minister of State, Foreign Office, as ""pedantic and obscure on Berlin, damaging and obscure on the Congo."" In turn, Mr. Godber was censured by Mr. Shinwell, former Labour Defence Minister, for having read the House an ill-prepared essay.","TH colby speeton LL ML Ac Oo Cacn ePLOATLA yokoR Mi se820. of Yio puccieereor Wires. sche 2Qo wase a boo urd \ueakRaod .

a05-094.png,"The trouble about such debates is that they range too widely. They remind one of the Rugby match in ""Tom Brown's Schooldays,"" in which all the boys were welcome to take part, and only those who ""really meant business"" removed their jackets. Not many metaphorical braces were visible in the early stages of to-night's debate. Mr. Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's golf-course Press conference, which he described as ""a display of flabby and fatuous complacency which takes us straight back to Neville Chamberlain.""","TRe, warty alive: sues. aaieke. buok Las vor 2 Koc AS TOMER | ""Thay, inane th CArnR od} ase Ran qdey inion le Buonow > Serticolalcye , ve we) SA OAR adr, beng Rocay a wWwR_ we\cmne, £0 Late pol, Orcs ny Moa we » oly waroul “x u * Ne Wusern 4Q_ BQUAGURAN bres yaokak, Noe mown wahoo hariceaN byacts WA VimOla a we lomeh s aaa Ly. acr \y shaq oo} ak ian Deg: harualliie « Wealiy Wack amtAncke i golf = COwWr AQ “Pages Ce ARian oR ‘ ee KQ_ OQecmbadh ay ~~ x Araplay ef flay a. vA "
a05-099.png,"A reference to the reunification of Germany brought a bark of ""Start another war!"" from Mr. Ellis Smith (Lab., Stoke on Trent S.). Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet theme of limitation of armaments in Europe. This could, he suggested, be linked with prohibition of the production of atomic weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection and control would be much easier to establish in these territories.","DS a5ec 8 6 es ee «k Gormouy Qwemgitlc a ork of See’ oe a Gon mer. Elia Sactu [Law , Slob oo Trad &, ee bor.

a05-104.png,"Mr. Healey denounced the Government for using double standards. Ministers had rebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the new Russian tests, but they themselves had no condemnation for events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for the Government, said Mr. Healey, to take up moral attitudes, ""especially when the temple of their religion is the bingo-parlour.""","hus, Weatny denararwK Wn Gooterowt Co“ Werg route sleooaa. buistes loa waBubad Wal ~alkcuad uvaku, fer ave COMA AR Re Vand ta hese, Bur rsx Pari atyr, hak uo coucktsnaken for werd OC.

a05-108.png,"This puzzled such students of comparative religion as had failed to detect this cult. But Mr. Healey had a partial and limited success.

a05-113.png,"True, he did tell the House that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests, and said that the council's findings would be published.

He resembles the elephant seal, an otherwise endearing creature whose articulation is limited, we are told, to a series of heavy sighs. Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas, M.P. for Leicester N.E., a former Labour Solicitor-General, and Mrs. Barbara Castle, M.P. for Blackburn, a member of the Labour party National Executive, delivered a letter to Mr. Soldatov, the Russian Ambassador, last night protesting against the Russian nuclear tests.","= en wltm Ce Whos wad Show od Ka Warad® ur oar OR ON KAS TR QA Mora RymQye | Faw ben wach yore, MAS.

a06-051.png,"There were loud cries of ""shame"" from all parts of the Conservative side. Mr. Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat down. A few minutes later, Mr. Fell got up and left the chamber.

a06-057.png,"This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more. ""I cannot be told to sit down by the Prime Minister."" Protests had been expected from Tory rebels. But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented.

a06-064.png,"Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had, if anything, rallied support to the Prime Minister. This apparently, was Mr. Macmillan's assessment. He confined his reply to the observation that Mr. Fell had probably ""maximised his support."" There were no other attacks of such ferocity.

b01-009.png,"The Archbishop has long been a courageous fighter against apartheid. He must be heard with attention.

b01-014.png,"He holds that more pressure can be put on South Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth than could be exercised were she cut off from it. On the other hand, those who favour expulsion, including African leaders, feel that nothing less than the shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr. Verwoerd and the Nationalists.

b06-012.png,His job is to build up the military apparatus which will back West Germany's economic domination of Western Europe through the Common Market.

b06-015.png,"A 90-day war, the West German view, provides the pretext for huge German armed forces (within Nato of course) and for those to have bases all over Western Europe. In the past year West Germany has secured agreements for ""facilities"" in France, Holland and Belgium. After much bargaining the British Government has agreed to give similar ""facilities"" to German troops in Britain.","A 2O0-clay war the West German lew, provides the prelecl dor huge Cernan armed desrces (usin Wale ck cotrse) ancl fer these te have bases al® coer Westem Panne ln the past year West Germany pas secured agreements tor ‘Pacbilies"" in France, Holland are Ertquum.

b06-019.png,"The process has been too slow for Herr Strauss and last month he attacked Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's plans for a ""unified supply apparatus"" in Nato.

b06-023.png,"Alongside these divisions a force of over 600 Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing up. These ""fighters"" are in fact fighter bombers which could launch an atomic attack on Eastern Europe. By 1963 the Germans plan to have nine missile battalions, with 288 missiles and 36 firing ramps, including weapons like Matador (range 950 miles), also provided by the Americans.","Hlorgiicle Mrer Awiiens a fore of over boo Starfighter provided by Me Awercans to yrowing up.

b06-027.png,"Last month West Germany was reported to be halfway toward this target. Her position as ""America's principal Nato ally"" grows stronger and stronger. Now this target which Herr Strauss and his fellows have their eyes on is control of the warheads to these weapons. General Heusinger, the man who caused a great disturbance last autumn with his demand of nuclear weapons for his army, now heads Nato's military planning committee.","Lor woul Wert Sow a WO fepoliea ro be ho jway’ ‘owald Hu TO, Hey flay ial ar"" Anuwncer onauipal a a yt SNOv Qupl eNOU WS toyed dl Hell Cro a Aus tdlow awe Hwic Z out Cot of Te. oul aale Ti 19€OjpOuc.

b06-032.png,"All this has been achieved through Nato under American leadership. But a big role has been played not only by the British Government but by Right-Wing Labour in this country.

b06-036.png,"Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in control. Nato, far from being a means of controlling the German militarists, is, in fact, the cover for building up their power. What must Britain do? Today, again, she has a key role.

b06-045.png,"For many years my union had to present its views to the two major conferences of the movement and take a licking. For us, unity meant accepting unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the movement and having a go next time. Alongside many others, we conducted our fight by putting down unambiguous alternatives to official policy and seeking to win majorities for them.","Tor tray fle rig sisal fal to presen , take “he.

b06-049.png,"When Scarborough carried our point of view we were naturally delighted, more so be- cause the alternatives had been put clearly to the movement, which had then chosen a vigorous anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German rearmament policy. Hopes rose as we saw a perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent lines of difference with the Tories. Many members understood that the bread-and-butter struggles of the union would become easier in the context of a movement advancing to attack the Tories on the whole front of their policy.","Whan Scarborougy Coamad our Qoint of view log Wie NAtVUfally delighted, mare so kaxcaus2 the alernatives had bean put clzarly te the mcuzment, Which had then chasen 2 vigsicus anti-Valo, anki Tey, anti-bomb and anti-German raarmament policy. |epes fo3< C5 We SAW a p2ispectve 2} Shap Stugg)|2 basad On conocer! ines o) difference with the Janes.

b06-053.png,"For we have always felt, even if we have then by our practice ignored it, the incon- sistency between support for the war alliance, with resulting colossal spending on armaments, and our basic effort to improve living standards.

b06-056.png,"They obstructed every effort to fight for the Scarborough decisions, while scratching around frantically to overturn them next time. Confusion of the original issue by misrepresentation of the decisions, the introduction of a pseudo third way and the call for party unity - in effect, a demand that the movement unite with the Gaitskellites on their policy and no other seems to have done the trick of moving a number of unions temporarily away from Scarborough decisions.","Scaslrorougl, deomer. rll BE sera liluly flaw.

b06-059.png,"It would become easy to become cynical and to despair. And yet, wherever the issues were put clearly, sections of the movement reaffirmed their original stand. Only where the issues were posed so as to cause doubt and confusion were positions lost. It is my view that this immediate confusion hides the fact that the Peace movement is still advancing and that clarification of the issues can bring a majority to secure the Scarborough decisions.","WU wohl Secoms aay 6 Cocom Gyscel ann to clayuic Ced ip! hoor Ae A a Aoarly, sector of te moctrn) r29ffomeel Ac crrpenel atlond Claby ate thy cnans weg Bl ce i ed. trite tee postion hh hs my sony sll A tonal ake tendluue tule de ha tt an chertprialn, of Ae ants con Lowy 2 mogery 8 tewe A Lhabonegh "

The Kennedy Ad- ministration's sharpened policies, the speeded-up drive to improve West Germany's armament, the new attempt to rush Britain into the European Common Market, and the kite-flying on Spain present a whole new proof that to abandon Scarborough is to expose Britain and her working class to sharp new dangers - that Gaitskellism is bankrupt.","All recent events show how correct the Scar borough dearsions were.

b06-071.png,"Ordinary working people will never rally to defend a policy founded on political chicanery or elect a Labour Government to carry through Tory policy - Gaitskell's stupid hope. The tragedy is that enormous inroads could already have been made into Tory strength by a fighting policy, based on Scarborough. THE desire for unity in the Labour and trade union movement following the discussions that have taken place during the past two years on defence is something that should be recognised by all concerned.","Qrdunary worlung ped pL will Newer rally to ddend & policy founded or POUWCAA Crucanory of dact a Labour Govemonk FO CAT) rough Ory palicy: Gartsals slupid Nope .The Wagedy \s ad enormous inroads coud akeady Mave bean, Made into Tory skengHe by & MGMing Pdlicy, based or a THE dasire Gr wuty I Ye Labour and Wadh Wor mMoeManU follawing WL "
b06-075.png,"At the same time that unity cannot be established on a false basis, or by creating further confusion within the movement. Unity will never be established on the basis of leaders being a law unto themselves and opposing conference decisions when it suits their own convenience. Unity can never be established by any formula uniting those who oppose German troops being trained on British soil and Polaris, and those who are for this policy - which is the same as that of the Tory Government.","At NZ Same Tims That Lary Cannot 52 2stablished on a false basis, or Dy Caahos Forher confusion within the movement, Unnly Will nzver be aslablishad on the basis o backs b2ing a law onto themselves and Oppasing confzencea décisions when it soins their Quon CONVENIANE - Unity con never be established by any formula Uniting those Who oppose Garman troops being “tainad on Botish sail and Ylaris and those Whe ate fr this policy - Which 15 the Some as that o} the Tory Goverment.

b06-079.png,"It is impossible for Labour's new Defence statement to unite the movement as the Labour leaders are not only in favour of American bases, but are in favour of German bases and troops being trained on British soil. The new Defence statement, while accepting that Britain cannot remain an independent nuclear Power, now supports the policy of depending on American nuclear weapons and the H-bomb, placing Britain in an even more dangerous position.","MA a mpenabl fur Nellie’ tea Jadhus ge oul ee & tocernd te Be Aewler 2 rot only fatou fo Cretan Go a for A ba, Be Army being parte om frrlead. sok he nee Vols Holrad, hele aeapta, pal Perle, co. et Amen a. ixtuneled woe Agen dyer pls potuy if Eipinliy on Cocori, eles eyen ane!

b06-082.png,"The statement of Padley and Crossman is no different in principle to the new defence statement. They accept American nuclear bases, and also the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy until some future date. They deceive the people by their talk of political and collective control of Nato. The Pentagon has made it perfectly clear who controls the American H-bomb, and who will actually give the instructions to press the button for nuclear warfare.","The rattohenart of [eiliy thd Corman 42 fe M foert nn pruncple e the ren clylerce ofeehooreut. hey beegel Utne m puclar Aes2, On tog fe tne off treclier heepon» tre puclear sftahyy duct rome faker coke.

b06-087.png,"There is only one way to develop unity and at the same time defend Britain. This was shown at the Scottish Trades Union Congress, representing 800,000 organised trade unionists, when it decided by overwhelming votes, to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions on unilateral disarmament, and to oppose Polaris and military bases being installed on the Holy Loch, or any other part of Britain.","Tae is ak, One ey dy divekys Unidz Cod oo ik feu bx ole fen ok Bulan.

The number of German film directors who have made first rate works in the last 25 years can be counted on the fingers of one hand: Frank Wysbar (""Fa""hrmann Maria""), Helmut Ka""utner (""Die Grosse Frei- heit No. 7""), Herbert Selpin (""Titanic""), Wolfgang Staudte (""Rotation""), and Georg Klaren (""Wozzeck"").","AFTER fer toys of indrurriterrt, mur fotal dws Mae ate Thdorw Whrrohinrel Clon patio ame ruddienly jolted Ande Ao bk Ay Anse ixtraodinary fluo ferred Michi'g “fea Uber ols Dakackiag® (“The Make of Eh Mlackiag"")and Midas anal Ortovionr'a “ha Mote.

c02-003.png,"It would now seem that Wicki's name must be added to this list, for his new film may well be a landmark in the revitalisation of the German cinema. Wicki is not only a director.

c02-007.png,"In 1950 he began to take photographs not only in Germany but also in Africa and America. An exhibition of these works which is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most impressive.

The chilling horror of ""Malachias"" is due as much to Wicki the photographer as to Wicki the director.

c02-017.png,"Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with considerable fidelity, the film tells the story of a little monk who prays that a disreputable night club near his church be removed. One night his prayer is answered and the offending establishment is suddenly transplanted to an island in the North Sea. But Father Malachias's troubles have only begun.

c02-026.png,"A summary of the story can give almost no indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry. He tells his story best in the faces of his crowds, recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat with brutal honesty, building up to a tremendous climax in the island orgy. Here, the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts, the wildly flapping white sails slashed by the glaring beacon of a lighthouse.","A Soreness of Moe aa Can “se Ant be cans of tte. ae Lrve21's ane de AAs a ) Qoxt ue ar f{o.es af (Us crass (2core os Cae wrutble at Aiey> of Suseed ""Iq : dese den aan gee je ech f Ape cles hence NR heel Man wae tee) Wik sailk lace Na arma Qeaecr ef a Salaliaets.

c02-030.png,"When the final miracle does occur, it is accepted as a marvellous joke; no one has learned anything. Wicki suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue. In complete silence he shows the faces of people walking in the streets, smug, content, satisfied, and thoroughly frightening. Wicki has succeeded in his second film in recording his personal apocalypse of the last days of a sick society.","Dhan He fuck miracle otew, Aa» aceagld wea mmawcLlows gorke; mome bas Learned angtlanp, lick: 2uckilenty schema to He city fora finuk eptopue.

His American bosses, 20th-Century Fox, have recently given Frankie the full, razzamataz, red-carpet treatment.

But it was Mr. Houston's evening. Earlier, on the Palladium show I found Stanley Holloway's act too long and not particularly entertaining.

d01-016.png,"The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with the Syn- optics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and plan and to the different public for which, or against which, the author wrote.

d01-019.png,"There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations. The present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history. The original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not the author, made what he could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.","eo lh gmp od hve wold chee! he ophs: dlcgabies aie Fal Goapel by erploabene bool on ccsomecl thyduul Alocabins.

d01-024.png,Most of those who expound a theory of textual dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was written entirely by one author before the disturbance took place but a few leave it open to suppose that the original book had been revised even before the upheaval. The ingenuity of the theories is impressive and is the best argument against them.,"Nost of these wha expaunol a thesvy of tetual Aislocahen tate it for grauteol that the Gospel was IMHteu etiraly by oe author loelore the Aistrbomce tool place but a Levy leave it open to Suppose. that the ariginal beck tac been remseol eveur before The Upheaval, The ingenuity oA the theories is impressive aud is the best ora Umer against trem "
d01-049.png,"The one real weakness of the Commentator's case is that, in common with all his colleagues, he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly how this enlargement was effected nor has he been able to explain the textual movements by showing that such changes are part of a simple and coherent plan. To understand how this is possible it is necessary to examine the text of the Gospel.","The one real weakness of He Commenksor- 's case is Mab, in common with all Wns caleagques he has nol, unhl now’, been able fo exhibit exachy how this enlarge ment was efckd nor has he been ole. te explain He xhal movements by showing Hal such Changes are part of a simple and coherent plan, To understand how his is possible itis necessary bo examine He lext of He Gospel . "
d01-052.png,THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly written in Greek. A modern text of the Gospel represents the work of generations of scholars who have compared the many manuscripts of John and worked out the version which is most likely to have been the original wording. It is not possible to establish any one text with absolute precision.,"THE Faueh Gagel vos alutast cerfa‘nly wrilen in Greek.

d01-056.png,"The most convenient one for the authors has been the text of A. Souter. In this version of the text the Fourth Gospel is printed as just over 1,000 different nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech occurring 15,695 times in their different grammatical forms. There are other texts which could have been used, and (as shown in Table 1) it is not a matter of the greatest importance which text is used.","The most Convent one Gor tre ators las bean te text of fA, Sof, [nr Tus Vasion of ha +xt tho foi, Cospet fc pated as yt ovey (Coe differtut nore , Whe, ono Onay parts of speck OC ur 46 [S655 Hees in tray, olifterest -atamtact'cey fois .

d01-060.png,"At first sight the difference between Souter and the other texts is rather large. But the British text includes the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman taken in Adultery, and this accounts for 178 words out of 279, which is the difference between the 15,695 words of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's. The omission or inclusion of this paragraph is a matter of editorial decision rather than scribal emendation, and it must be included in the Gospel and studied, even if the result of the study were to decide that the paragraph should then be excluded.","At firs Sicht tHe differ;a befrerin Soutey aud Me ofa, fexts ig (ahha; lage .

d01-080.png,"The bar was the commonest marking, but others were also used. Dots sometimes served in place of the bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as it is now used to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H. Roberts is of the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel some markings would be used, although which, it is impossible to say.","Tha Or WAY MHA COMMONS WOAIAG, ka Oko WER NEO USed OAS SOM na Served W PlAc@ GFLre NOS, Gud Mere Ox COS2S WhOK SPAN AS USLA OS ie AS TOD LRA LO WOR O PTAge—L erg, WEGUYY CAA AALS WHENGS WEE Ountler Car.

d01-085.png,"Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that the original of the Gospel would be unmarked. The original of the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex, whether paragraphed or not, would be laid out in columns. This is the invariable practice of ancient manuscripts. A common size of column would hold about one third of a page of Souter's print.","COKS8K =.

d01-098.png,"The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel and the sheet wound round this central pin. The roll made a simple and serviceable book. It was robust - the number which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of this - and it was easily stored. It had two disadvantages. It was generally a single-sided form of book, and it was not an easy form of book in which to find a reference.","“he aolge of His cleck ves offabed to a cooker olovel avd He sleet round round Hes centel pain he cll uroole a Simple ard mwoicecble lock. tt cma pobuit He umber olEX (eve Survived Ue Birtuces is auple guridem of Wis - ad it sos corily shored. tt Led tro dirackvontages, It wed gonerelly a Sinyle~sicked form of beole , avd if tier tof an eosy form of book in vlih = to Rid a "
d01-104.png,"This last objection might have had some weight in ecclesiastical circles. In his Natural History, 13.11-12, the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making. As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79, his information is contemporaneous with the New Testament. The other form of book was the codex. In this the sheets were bound together down one edge much as they are in modern books.","hada Geil slemehnn wcll ene bac ones aia dy adesiashcol circles. be Lis Nedueel Heshory | AS MM AL , the older Pliny fells of Ra ux of pepyrus ic col we Lin As Pliwy wos lillod i 4a erupko~ of Uesmviaa pdeced pvschelwedl derculaucum ak Rupe iW AD.79, Us pies fb cohewmporondoss wil He now Texto}, te offs brn of bool vos Ha coolex. le es Ke slats wer loowrel toge He Bore om gg week as Wey OW ih wo Aes. books "
d01-118.png,"Against these advantages the codex was fragile and might be bulky. It is sometimes possible to tell whether or not a particular text was written on a roll or a codex. Rolls were prepared for writing, but any papyrus left unused at the end could be cut off. If the text was longer than the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.","Agesrat Mevat aduen kages Mat codex pos fyayile am night be Lrbly.

d01-123.png,"The verso of the roll was blank, and one cannot think of an author, Mark for example, sending out his Gospel lacking the ending, while one whole side of his roll was unused. The codex form was not so accommodating. Even in the case of the single-sheet quire, an extra sheet glued on might have to be gummed on over the binding, or the whole codex rebound.","The wea of Me soll was bMouk, ancl one cammot Hunk of an author, Mark for 2x ample, dindiing on] eis Gospel backing the sncing, Whale one arhol acl of Las roll pcg Larndael, Ue cock form 0a wel go accommodahing Eotn jn tee coae Of Mae ving dheet quire, an Lcla. thud glud on pruight hae o Le gummrcl on ovr Ye binching, or the whole cocix pebhorund "

d04-012.png,"The word Shamir was used as a personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew word ""SHAMIR"" means guarded or preserved. Therefore, the real man, who regards him- self as insignificant, as the prayer says: ""What am I? A worm"", he is the Shamir and such a man fulfils the Shmah, loves the Lord God with all his heart, and with all his soul and with all his might and studies the word of God.","Me She ee personel name (Git. 686 ) the ced SHAMIC” means querded or presev- vel Therefore, the real men, who veqacds eet) kk bn signi Licewh vs the Prager Sups: Whol on 1?

d04-016.png,"This man is the worm, the creature that cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such a man is the Shamir that guards himself against all the irrelevant pleasures.

We have all come across human Shamirs and they leave a deep impression on our feelings and senses. They make us the Altar for God to emit the Light which can be read in every language. The Shamir is the ""seventh"" and most important creature, that was created on the eve of the Sabbath, to bring the Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.","She Shaw Is dally lite writes the Decaloyue which Is we Hey oy two plates Hho hard tacts of UR, ayd all fock are ‘oye.

And the Talmud tells a story, which is also in the Hagadah that Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said, ""I am nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that people should read 'the going out of Egypt' the passage Numbers 15, 37-41, by night"", because the fringes (tsitsits) are only used in the day; till Ben Zoma came and explained the verse (Deut. 16, 3) ""that 1thou 1mayest remember the day when 1thou 1camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of 1thy life.""","coeins those two Lecsoms.

The Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual principle and this gives us ""a wink"" (Remez) how to live and accept all the bitterness that is hurled against us.

d05-008.png,"The new century opened with James 1 ascending the throne. He was quite prepared to be tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot spoiled that.

d05-025.png,"In that year Shakespeare had just turned forty and had written Hamlet two years before. Bacon was at work and Milton was just learning to read. James was followed by Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and became the foster mother of some of the most important Prayer Books in the Anglican Communion.","In thal year Shakerpeare bad yusk tuined far bg ud Mad writter Hamlet (wo year — tefyre.

d05-030.png,"Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud, now so much nobler a figure than former historians led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly with James and Charles, the Puritans argued, was necessarily a menace.","favever asseviatled WH Cartes 3 Arch fra land, how So twice, nobler a fanre fran polner bishyian, Led wa be beliete.

Far better to help them to face whatever it is that is worrying them, to find the original cause and then deal with it; show it up either for the sham it is - and many fears are based upon completely irrational pre-conceived notions - or to show how we may deal with it so as to remove the power to torment us that it seems to possess.","In the first place it is not a great deal of use {telling Even Children, as |have alicady suggested, not to be silly Or to pull themselves together.

d06-003.png,"Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child by laughing at what are very real fears. As adults, we know that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable, but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the other side as victors.","Gin yor th vi Traomndans camnye may be cme to a child j ant at what ae my real frase.

d06-008.png,"To ridicule them only pushes them farther into themselves, so that they become unable to speak about it to anybody and the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown, the harvest of which may still be being reaped at forty or fifty.

d06-011.png,"Because situations which may contain all the elements of fear can arise suddenly, it is a good idea to condition a child to some extent against it. To keep a child of twelve or thirteen under the impression that nothing nasty ever happens is not merely dishonest, it is unwise. As I shall suggest in a later chapter there are some situations which occur less frequently than they did once, or at least do not now arise until a later period of life, but this is no reason for leaving a child in complete ignorance to the extent of even lying to it when it asks questions.","Recaunx whotione tfuch or, contiten MA €2 a ttle 0 conldhan o htd Ao sae ech agperal ef. lo Atego @ cteele/ of fltle ort hurler cerole, be bbs opr Mine ate tne hdibin "
d06-015.png,"A little more honesty, even if one refrains from going into too many details, would help many a child to make a proper adjustment to life as it grows up. Let us look at Jesus.

d06-037.png,"To others, the long hours of the night bring only a disturbed tossing and turning which causes them to wake feeling worse than when they went to bed.

d06-046.png,"Even more simply, test your own reactions to different situations. There are some which bring on an almost immediate feeling of tiredness - such as when your wife mentions the washing-up - while others, if they refer to something you like doing, bring a veritable surge of energy. Many a girl who is 'too tired to help mum' will later jump up with no apparent tiredness at all when her boy friend calls and go for a long walk.","Sven ware Guydy, CS your ony seachous te Afferent thrahow. /hera ae Jour which, honing On ab c/uwotd retuwectar feelug oS hreoew ~ buch at chen your wife uchthan Le Leathing-up — while often, they Mefer He Vouclhjng you ble Sarg, Snhg 4 venhable durge of eusrgy. lauy @ girl Hho it Yeo Wired to hep tylty’ Wi Ger jute lp tlh bo Gpparent hredheit at ab “hey her hoy frat Cal auc! go fer elong Halk.

d06-050.png,"Nor is she necessarily being deceitful. She really did feel tired until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an attractive - interest! Tiredness has, therefore, as much to do with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion. A disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense of fatigue.

d06-060.png,"One of the greatest steps forward that has been made this century is the way in which illness of the mind is no longer feared or shunned, and is in fact no differently regarded than physical illness.

When news from the Continent took days, from America weeks, from the Far East, months, even a Prime Minister could go to sleep in blissful ignorance of what might be happening at the other end of England, whereas today, everybody, let alone the Prime Minister, knows of happenings the other side of the world, within minutes of their taking place.","Iy Koa lays sha, worl peapla were born, Lived aud chad wt, the bouuyolaris of foo village , Huet hot lifcult fer anybory % 4ve aday ata Aut.

It is easy, desperately easy, to lead a 'double' life without ever deliberately planning to do so or in fact being conscious of what is going on. It is easier to live life in compartments but over the years it builds up, and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which need to be handled correctly.","In MaNyCadcd teis Hames ksavs litle ck iheis Pace cP skanAireis assaciatea at HE QTC’ Gh WAKES Wands Llhas they they QE.

If we would only sit down and write out all the necessary jobs waiting to be done and then work quietly through them, we would find life considerably less exhausting - and in the end we would do more.","Je pecvadl wet jire tye Ul fir Mt for He “iri Yoh a08 0 fT, ( fete lO O roost tie voter flr pM fe an tip Le Le utl va bey? pan well flit UE; httte?” Le pe ty te goy wie, | few Me wise PA ll wor 2 fll met jy plloatle Jo tif ailergey OLR M7 wert tata yay Ube 7 Bey od Me 7 Ge W774 Mit 79 we Bede2 Ow we cit af Vea MEET pele wivilirg We dh ten are tod tly ‘guiy thoigh Lei WZ, ee eee fd tt Lata fd Mute "

d07-082.png,"(Actually, the Mishnah quotes two further proof texts and the Gemara explains why these, too, are necessary, but a careful examination of that passage makes it clear that these are not quoted here because they are not necessary to prove the point made by R.

d07-085.png,"From the above it follows that here, once again, we have a good illustration of how a sugya has been fashioned from material already in the hands of the Redactors. The sugya is built around the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi.

d07-089.png,(This is probably to be understood as a well-known comment on the verse; quoted by Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b. Levi's thesis!) The proof text of greeting by the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah. There is no reference to the Mishnah here because the Mishnah deals with the actual practice of greeting by the divine Name and the Gemara here quotes the texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi.,"(This i probally bo he uuderstooek asa well- bust cqnuet on Hie yerse , quoted! by Cautrth in supper of (is fess ad quoted Leis ecis!)

d07-100.png,"The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple is then quoted and the interpretation of the latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh is added, not because this is at all relevant to the discussion but because it was a familiar interpretation which had become so well known that it was invariably quoted whenever the verse itself was quoted, almost as if it were a part of the verse.","Tea proof text of brewging the hile bo the Temple iS Hee ourcledl avd the ater pretiher of tee holes part of the verse By Caw box Pall 6 added) rot Lecause tus is at 2h relevacd lo ee te discussie bet because st was a fouriliar ndterpretahor. wlucly Vs Aeconre Se wthh brown flak + was invariably guotecl werever the vwerce itself yas quoted , aluost asf at were a part of the verse .

It suffered a decline and fell into lamentably low standards in the fussy over-furnishing of the Victorian age but it would take more than a temporary lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely, viable craft.

e01-102.png,"Remember that texture plays an important part in the beauty of crochet. The finer mercerised threads are more effective for the delicate designs used for tablecloths, doilies, edgings and accessories, while the heavier threads are used for bedspreads, chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks are made of steel, composition or bone.

e02-000.png,"A great deal of modern furniture has tapered legs, and in reproduction period pieces they are frequently used. The simpler varieties are extremely easy to work, the four sides being simply planed to give the required taper.

e02-014.png,"For short ones a smoothing plane can be used. The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers on the newly planed surfaces, and these treated as before.

e02-018.png,"A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom end reveals when the required amount has been removed, and if care is taken to stop the plane short of the squared pencil line at the top, the work will be accurate.

e02-021.png,"Incidentally, it is better to complete any mortising that may be needed at the top before the tapering is begun. Some plain tapered legs have the taper on the two inner faces only, the outer surfaces being vertical as at (B), Fig. 1.

e02-074.png,"But why woodwork in particular? Well, there are many reasons. Wood is in good and common supply; it lends itself to making innumerable useful household items - furniture, fitments, garden items, toys, etc.; it enables results to be obtained fairly quickly; it is less expensive than most other materials; it is a pleasant material to work with; and, although it does create a certain amount of mess, it is all clean and easily cleared away.","‘Bud wre weceA wert in pasheutarg ?

e02-082.png,"This last point is certainly important because almost everyone has come to recognise that machines are not only an economic necessity, but that a great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the installation of a power tool.

e02-086.png,"Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin with what we have called a bare minimum kit. Probably most men have some of the tools already. It will enable a man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in any case may be regarded as a good beginning to which other tools can be added as the need arises. The nature of the work will probably dictate the additions to be made, but as a guide we have given a fuller kit which increases the range of things that can be made enormously.","¢ gming now fo the achal foals and ther cost we begin with what we have called a bar lmnimum bit. fro Jablhy wos} men have some of the fools alicady lt will chayle a man tf mate simple shaight - folwatd things , and in any case May be fegaided as a good beqianag bv Hhich othe §=fools can be added asthe need ases. the natute of the wok will probably clictatc the adadipors fo te made, but as a guide we have gia a fuller Ut Which — incteases the tange of things that can be mate t/o/mo usly, "
e02-091.png,"As a still further development, we follow with a good basic kit, which includes the fuller kit (which in its turn, of course, includes the bare minimum kit).

e02-094.png,"Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and machines, the choice of which will depend partly upon the space available in the workshop, the amount one is prepared to pay, and the type of work a man normally does. First, however, a word of advice generally. Do not buy so-called cheap tools or machines. They never are cheap in the long run. They may be inaccurate, the steel may be soft (or possibly too hard) so that the edge either crumbles or is brittle, or they may not be robust enough for the work they have to do.","lastly , we Surgest tar pone fools ao wrathrnss , He Mok of wh wil ole pe oA pra wprr the ipace AVA! 12.

e06-000.png,"This could hardly happen without the herring having some orientation with the sea bottom. It means that the crowding is caused during the daytime, and that the herring must continue to migrate over the ground as well as in midwater and during the swim (the swim at East Anglia is always from the north).","[bir Cpe Fictihy Aryan wtlsed fax fimirg kevin Abie Otte fafrer, trftr foe Ara Loft. ff praterr feat fe Hottie 1) Clhectoyl Resitn fie Hig fprme, te’ fla Mb Lurring eS Gtk & weg role QOLr Le fread 24 wele bs ce genitwaler Zee Aires fre devin (ta turrer at Lael sei 7a Uwaye fran, fe zoe) "
e06-003.png,"Thus we can see that herring movements, although primarily instinctive perhaps, and certainly helped and hindered by water flow, are also closely related to the sea-bed geography. Geography, too, names the great fisheries that depend on them: the Fladen Ground (where again most big shots are taken on the edges), the Gut, a deep- water channel to the Dogger where the herring spawn along the northern edge; a good contour map will almost define the migrations of these summer herring.","Lhit?

e06-006.png,"The effect of bottom congestion due to the light pressure is inevitably mixed with that of the suitability of ground for spawning. Both result in crowding, so there is no need to try to separate them - thank Heaven! A good picture of this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning grounds from the Viking in the north down to the Klondykes and the Reef along the western edge of the Norwegian Deep.","The <¢ffect of lattemn congestion due to the lignt pressure is Inevitably mixed with that of the suitalility of ground for spawning: Both result in crowding , SO thexe IS ho nescd im Hy © Separcice them - Thank Heaven!

e06-010.png,"In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom. Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the echo- sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-spawning herring are always found.","Ay i 200 = /thom french the = ao nek touch the be u. 7) her deren obpe al he nal of he a f fraore.

e06-015.png,"The joint evidence of echo-sounders and fishing gear leads to an overall though some- what dim picture. The details are harder still to see. Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance, shoals that gather at the Knoll or other banks are most of them going to travel a hundred miles farther south before they spawn. Some will spawn at the Hinder banks, which are half-way; and it may be that in their southerly march the herring will spawn wherever the suitable gravelly bottom soil coincides with their final ripeness.",Me youd wwdltnce of teto- gacerielers aad fistins Mia? 0 an pttad Ahaiyp Soorerde letn pecheine Lhe cletuls ate tpler pth tr 20e iil tfoh.

Yet there will always be some that find it if enough are travelling, just as the robin who gets back exactly may be only one among thousands who do not. But this southerly migration is not accidental. Being contranatant or against the drift, it probably has a survival value in ensuring that the fry after hatching are drifted back into the normal home of the adults, by the water flow through the English Channel into the North Sea.","jo ba @u2val of ang fel certar gheB@ Mele ale eccfheu Yrriuing Pioeui may fe 2cieu fal.

e06-026.png,Drift in another form probably explains how these migrating herring are biased to east or west by the different winds. Strong westerlies are well known to bring good longshore fishings. The surface water that is blown offshore must be replaced by an underflow bringing with it the herring to the Norfolk and Suffolk beaches.,"Jef Me Cnothes form platy eplurs how Mes i 0h; herp ¢ Cue Gee lo cas/ or urea t th pe Ll fleseph writs.

e06-030.png,"Easterly winds, on the other hand, mean no herring along the shore, as recent years have shown. A succession of winds is needed for this effect of course - one breeze will not do it, though a very hard westerly will often start off the ""local"" herring; but quite apart from this wind effect there is an easterly drift special to this rump of coastline, caused by the meeting of water from north and south.","Mil , of AN efltr pum Miter 10 trey, chtty, Me Mert, w2 Attited Nyt Mn? 0 gicenin of witile £3 tot fr 1a offtet of COMMA -—one Cheyp Atl 104 ob tt, Mecigf ' tery Mor waery “ey ofhen gd aff fhe eel Miter, tet ged afead prot Mii ttl iff Mhe thechiy, 0 theker flow tort asl ath "

It is strongest at spring tides, when without wind you will ""set"" out - or drift to the eastward, the length of half a fleet of nets - almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's Knoll.

e06-046.png,"(Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may be by actual contact, or by sight reaction to the disturbed sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations through or along the bottom.)

e06-049.png,"Let us consider first what would appear to be the simplest case - that of flat fish on the bottom. The evidence suggest that the fish are aware of the moving footrope before it reaches them.

This suggests that the wave might be transmitted by the sea-bed, though the footrope in this case was actually just off the bottom and was indeed passing over some fish.","Jutn py we OUULT, LD OE cpt. fé the thi - Jee file Me wweofly wee VO tage yoot Gd tbe fit, Jad vitie Calpe fe ) feet oo) Ls waynes ad ey Mig fe oy ditt dard, av bei jitl Ke iff leit ME lett le be tan iattld hy LE ja tt. eegP fee t flay L te tel 0H tas toatl pod le tit WI OF MLE OT 9 Lt Jeu fab "

Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered essential to catch round fish whose reaction to disturbance would be upwards.","Actually WHC SNe Hed Has Little ot NE canes PRIN ANID Lilen Woe, Hee ch ne Asn WAS Small, a MAaal afoak at tus.

According to Dr. Max Beier in ""Fangheuschrecken"" (Die Neue Brehm Bu""ckerei, 1952), the praying mantis is trecking northwards.","troux~ the og it Watches i The Spriigy rut et oes ca te lak autumn , the pragiy~ wants satifros 15 Vovacitg bg Lola other suseels.

e07-072.png,"DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes since the end of the war, clay pots are still in greatest demand. It is mostly in the smaller sizes that the substitutes have made headway, and although numerous small clay pots are used each year, they are fewer than they were 10 years ago. In the larger sizes there is still no real substitute for clay that can be obtained at a comparable price, except the bituminized paper pots which are used on commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes and chrysanthemums.","DESPITE Ale stlooly (flex of SUGS4t Hates sruce the tal of He war, clag poh are AMC fn ven es€ olewaudl . tis mostls ty the strcllae scres thot Lhe substi luks have weole how & y aero abthouh UiiLimeovous straetl ee, pos are sea cock year, they art [ower thou they wee CO ytone ego . lu the larger i223 Lheve 13 stel/ uo neal subslrlele fo cla thot can 4e Obtouued at 4 Comparable pres, Lkceph tha bil reir e0€ paper pos rohcek ave use on "
e07-076.png,"The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its brittle nature; even with reasonably careful handling, the annual losses are often around 10 per cent., and where the handling and storage facilities are not too good, these losses will be even greater. This does not necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as they are not quite so fragile as the smaller ones and are not normally thrown about in quite the same way.","ArHtth. mettre ; avn wth rearornatly carpal tameling, Tha ammmak Marais acre flim avovmel 40 por cent, ancl where Aha Korotling anol plorng. focithin are ret Jew goort, thre Annis il wim Ae greeter, Thin cboes met ractonarity apply ta Hhe Anryer ates , 0 Hhay are mot grate. ve pongil. an the aareller eras ancl mre rel normety Ahrown atent wm grat The narra ay .

They are fairly heavy and difficult things to accommodate and they must have some protection from severe weather, which can be quite a headache in a small garden.

e07-094.png,"Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay pots for plant raising. These are compressed blocks of compost, made in a specially devised press to simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot. Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they are made of the same compost as would have been used in a pot, the only difference being that it is used in a slightly moister condition.","Soi( blocks ave pro babl y the oldest alkwuctive to clay pots for Plant Veising .

e07-098.png,"Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them in the normal way, the only real difference being that more of the watering is done through a rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout of water. First-class plants of tomatoes, cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers, celery and onions, may all be raised in soil blocks; so can such flowering plants as dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas, lupins and numerous others.","Sek & Sowou , ov Kedlings ave pricked out mto thee hy the novme( boay , thc uly veal ale ffeveuce heing thal move of the Coakev is (S done through @ voye to avoick bveeking the block ith a Spout of wake.

e07-101.png,"One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved completely. Manufacturing the block and planting it is very little more trouble than normal potting, and a superior plant, which transplants more easily, is produced. The obvious limitation is that soil blocks can only be used for propagating; there can be no progression to a larger block when the plant or seedling is ready to be moved; it must be planted out or potted.","One big acl Vande se Of Soil blocky is tn Obvious ove: the cos of « pot of Guy Acicviphion is Saveck Completely, Menu faclavins the bleck avd planks if i wey ile move Pouble then nova polos , intl es: Su periow plant, tslaicl, fraurplaads move easily , is prockuceel.

You will then be a well-established learner and the world will be at your feet.

There is a lot to be said for keeping the word ""soul"" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word ""mind"" for the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which are clearly associated with the brain.","did thes gts pele Moma 0 Me heed toed oll idence of “tial” peaceler of aug rok Sor tenn bier.

f01-070.png,"Can we now put forward any reasonably clear picture of this ""basis"" of mental phe- nomena? The physicists have succeeded remarkably well, with the atomic theory, in giving a clear and detailed picture of the basis of such material phenomena as chem- ical action, magnetism, the behaviour of gases and so on. Where has psychology got to in its theories of ""mind""? Are there any ultimate units of mind akin to the atoms of matter?","Mefure of Me Aaais' of fa marutal phtraratiua!

f01-075.png,"At one time it was thought that mind could indeed be analysed into discrete bits. These bits were identified as elementary sensations. These were thought to combine together to form compound experiences by analogy with the way atoms of matter combine to form molecular compounds. But this view led to too many difficulties and was finally abandoned. Nevertheless the search for basic units of mind has gone on and will doubtless continue, for it is the aim of science to discover ultimate units.","At one time it was thougt that mind could indeed be analysed mto discrete bits .

f01-081.png,"We must beware, however, of supposing that there must be any close analogy between the units of quite different sciences.

f01-085.png,There have been many conflicting tendencies in psychology in its search for ultimate units and here we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising concept which is current today.

f02-038.png,"The large attendance and atmosphere of this Conference, held in October, 1957, reflected not only an increasing awareness of the problems of men and women nearing or already in retirement but also a strong desire on the part of all concerned for concerted action towards preparing men and women for life in retirement and more adequate provision of facilities for crafts, hobbies and leisure-time interests for those who are retired.","Te Laz Cogs Aandlowee ancl ateayyhore of Hh Lovlerence-, Ctl Cad, flechl nok nly an ennenng aunavenens LG. pollins of men On ner ath ar abisacG sm retirtmtnt Ce aloe 2 >For ove om KE part! ole concern Lay Crh teh oa: or maps ant icc ae waa Se ome | Mellin peel Gow cree. ae. ihn the pe a ae "
f02-040.png,"As a result, the Glasgow Retirement Council came into being in April, 1958, with Dr. Andrew Hood as chairman and Mr. Andrew Atkinson as secretary. The Council has active committees on Education and Preparation for Retirement, and on Occupa- tional Centres. The former consists of representatives from the Glasgow Corporation Further Education Department; the Workers' Educational Association; the University Extra-Mural Education Committee and departments of psychology, education and so- cial science; the trades unions; and the Regional Hospital Board, together with an industrial medical officer and a Medical Officer of Health.","fs a Nsidt, the Glasgow Yefiiewout Cowcil Chwe Te Neus ia Apel, ATS, wlth Dr. Audtenl tlaod as clairwat dud Th. dudtew Manson as secretary.

f02-044.png,"In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director of Education for Glasgow, that industrial firms might be ready to let older employees attend day- release courses on preparation for retirement, their wages paid for the time thus spent. An approach was made to about twenty large firms and in October, 1959, the first experimental day-release course for men was organised. Eleven students from seven firms attended a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both to the men and their employers that the venture was an experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much as the participants.","ik ABS it tas cogeced Me TK Soul, dat deter of Elucanhen 46r Anion dat indlastnal finns tga be end () Wt ollie amployers afend cayrelinge Comes &n repouahin foe pine AA ages pd for HAC ct hi sunt An Approach Way wade to about draty lange firms ind im Ce deur, A554, Hk rt enpuninvatal Cay releace course 14 Nn WAC eemesed Cyan abniuks from son dirs at did a gue on gix Gull Mndoys amd it was wade clear Dadh tt dhe man od Yeu eimyleyars at Yiu Votre.

f04-004.png,"When he learned what was causing the commotion he became greatly alarmed, and after the body had been taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth Camp, aged thirty-three, the girl who was to have been his bride. There was little doubt of how she had met her death, and even less that it had been murder.","Wha be bsined ket wal Canin, the tonntbion he few gall tnd, nf fed ld ibn UT ae eae oor Hopils/ tad bs pif alia doh, hensly datify, Thgah (mp j ay Aik, he, he girl who wd 4 hyve bre, his deck.

f04-007.png,"She had been struck several times with a blunt instrument, and her head was smashed in. There were signs of a violent struggle, blood on the cushions and floor, and the re- mains of her broken umbrella. But a pair of bone cuff-links found in the compartment seemed to provide the only possible clue to the killer.","Sh, hel fn Mack feck face wis Oe in¢tromen tan her hud wer gmerhe in, There tere cont of «vielen b chee Ce, Mead a rhea en fe a of a bls. «On F pew f hianicn: trop = tink fone aa com pectment Lewd, do provide He ly pcb cle te Ke iz "
f04-011.png,"The body was examined, and it was definitely established that no sexual assault had taken place. It seemed probable that the motive had been robbery, and this was fur- ther confirmed when a check was made with the woman's relations in Hounslow. Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the Good Intent, a public-house in Walworth. Her day off was Thursday, and before coming up to London in the evening she had called on her two sisters, one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the other at Hounslow, where she kept a shop.","The bok, wih ckoumined, gud iF wif dhe fiactel wlalelad Hale ro senizh wheade tepals phe Tt Samed pobobe Ad te wake tel to rohbury , oad dads wat och confirred ins ek ch ed ih Ie comes al Homsles.

f04-016.png,"Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon, and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M., where she had tea with her other sister, and then went to catch the 7.42. Her sister saw her to the station, helping her with some of her packages. This sister was able to establish that she had carried a green purse and had bought a railway ticket.","Elinobelh lad bt Dacnarectl A Has aferton, gh aded st dices sql S CRE dag ohe tte ok & bie a 2 wet 4, calel she 4.42. th osAler dow ber 4 te Sa helring oe = ee af hey pokigh ie aie ad a 4 ee tel te bd citried gree porte aacl had beoskt 2 oitiroy thet "
f04-020.png,"But both purse and ticket, and the packages, were gone when the body was found at Waterloo. Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it likely that she had been carrying much money. A porter at Hounslow supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her compartment when the train left, but this did not help much, since it had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo.","Br Vell pre ond bedih, an He pcage, sore gon salen Me Day meso found ab Whlenlbe.

f04-024.png,"The police began a systematic search of the line - no easy task, but one in which patience and method paid off. At a spot on the embankment between Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained pestle such as chemists use, with some hairs sticking to it. The murder weapon, more than likely, and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a killer to book in modern times.","ihe police beqon a S\S4ematic Search of che U ine wa easy fash, but ove iy which patience dnd merkod paid nes Ay oo spot on the embankment between Puaney ond Wanksworeh chey Found or bhooksiained pesile Such AS chemist WS withe Some harry Heuway 4s ie the wuyder weapon, more khan Lively, cwak perhaps ed vee aoe to have reas at ‘Mey 49 book in wo AO times "
f04-028.png,"But in 1897, alas! there was no fingerprint bureau, no experts to check and photograph any 'dabs' it might have yielded. It was a tough case to tackle, and Superintendent Robinson, of the L.S.W.R. Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of Scotland Yard, combined forces in the investigation. While accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been attacked for the sake of robbery, they did not overlook the possibility that this might have disguised another motive, and a thorough check of her former men friends and acquaintances began.","But iw AIA4 abas! sheve wtS wa Finger pratt bareow, wo eK fers 40 checy old ey m4 ? babe?

f04-032.png,"They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours, some well meant, some mis- chievous, including one that a man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on the Thursday evening, with blood actually dripping from his hands. The inquest was opened on February 17, but, beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage in which she had died, there was nothing on which to proceed, and the inquest was adjourned.","They also hoyto Cope worth We USuaf Llood at Te mou eS - me wath means, Some Mi Chi eyous, i ncdu Sina one thar a man Nars 62en Sen FRetine, from Vau K hale Stockton OW the FhursdsaQay Evening, with bLoor actually sv. eriMy Crom Nis Nands Wea + WQuest wes opene » OF) Pobruacy 4, Gur, btyon ® tne \ury Nearing a Formol CA ENA & CAtIOMN OF the Victim ans 1Mse COM at Uaterloo ene CON OOM iw which she Nox Sie there Warn No Mims om wo CW!

f04-035.png,"Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely trails. It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending money to her relatives, and her brother-in-law was asked for a detailed account of his movements on the 11th. The dead woman had been engaged once before - to a barman named Brown.","Poy by doy the Ppokice Followed up Ukaly ams even anh rely t¥QACS- I wos QeornsdS thor Eli 2. be4h Came haa loeen feanding money to ney veloti ves, ow Her brother - In- law wes asked For a wailed AGocKt OF MUS Mevemants on Ahe Alan.

f04-039.png,"This man agreed that his engagement had been broken off after one particular tiff, but denied that he owed Miss Camp any money. All the while the police were casting about for a man who had been seen leaving the train at Wandsworth. A passenger described this individual as a man of about thirty, of medium height, with a dark moustache, and wearing a frockcoat and a top-hat.","VWis man agreed that his engagement hed ben broken off ap after one particu lar bff but dened that he owed Miss Came Any money.

f04-043.png,"The porter at the station bore out this description, but the man was not traced. Perhaps the news of their search got around, for a man did obligingly present himself at Wandsworth police-station, claiming to have committed the murder - but he was mentally defective, and, despite his claim to infamy, had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening.","The eorter ot td stakon bore out this Destriphion, but the man was not 4d traced, Perhaps the wews of their search got Bound, for a wan did bk.

f04-046.png,"Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body, which had at first been considered as belonging to the killer, proved yet another red herring, for it was learned that they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one of her sisters. A young man from Reading named Marshall had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner.","Lven the done catt-Links found beside the body , which hod at Pirst been considered oar belonging tothe kidLer, Proved uek another fed herring kor Vk wos learned Hat Yrey hed been borrowed by Elizabeth Grp brom one of hey sisters.

f04-049.png,"This man was known to have left his home on February 11, and to have been away for four days. Not in itself a crime, but, added to the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guildford for a false moustache, it left him with something to explain. His story was that he had left home to try to join the Army (presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance his military bearing), and this was accepted.","Te ae wad Known to have Left his howe on February IN and to hove been away Por four days.

f04-053.png,"And so the inquest, which had dragged on, with adjournments, until April 7, finally had to be content to return a verdict of ""wilful murder against some person or persons unknown."" The most vital clue of the Wedgwood pestle had been of no assistance. The killer must have been very thankful that the science of dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings.","Nad co the inquest which hed dreaged on, with adjourmments awtil neil 7, filly bed fo be conlen to pelurn « verde of Psidhed wutde again] come percon or persons. unknown.” The mest vitel clue of fhe Wedqueed pectle Mal beon of ve assistance.

f04-057.png,"The next female fatality occurred eight years later, yet so strange were the circum stances that it was a further seven years before even a ghost of a solution emerged. There has always been something sinister in the idea of tunnels. The building of them was one of the most dangerous jobs connected with railway construction; and there were many people who believed that to travel through tunnels would be an equally hazardous business.","The werd Pemade falilty cccurred eight jeure date yet sa strange were the circumctances that it wal a Further seven years bedore even a ghect of solution emerged, There hes al wags been something sinicle im fhe idea of tumels.

f04-061.png,"Some thought that the result would be all sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the confined atmosphere. ""The shareholders who travel by it will be so heartily sick, what with the foul air, smoke and sulphur, that the mention of a railway will be worse than Ipecacuanha,"" wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was proposed to build the Box Tunnel.","Some theupht that the tent wolf be ahh sors of hertibke (Lenefes brought on 64 the coupined atmosPhree.” The sharehobdetr who Travel oY it wil 6 Se heactilf siCK, What With the fouk aft, Smeke and Subphuz, that the wention ) of a talkway wih b€ Werse thay |pecrcuanhe ; Wt@tE An ant - car lwag Id astTeeife Whey it we Propesed to buitd the x Tunnee.

f04-064.png,"The mere thought of subterranean travel gave others a feeling of danger. A medical journal said, ""the deafening peal of thunder, the sudden immersion in gloom, and the clash of reverberated sounds in a confined space combine to produce a momentary shudder, or idea of destruction, a thrill of annihilation."" It was also prophesied that passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the darkness.","‘The meze thepht of Subtecaneay trwe? Gave otheS a feting of Aaypet.

f04-068.png,"For all that, as far as England is concerned, there have been only two occasions on which a body has been found in a tunnel in circumstances pointing to murder. The first was that of Mr Gold, in the famous Lefroy case, and by an odd chance the second tragedy occurred on the same line, although this time the victim was a woman.","Nor old x oA , od Vor ad Crallorrd > Concenred + ose.

f04-071.png,"Though in the minds of most people there was no doubt that the woman had been the victim of foul play, the verdict brought in was that there was not sufficient evidence to show whether she had fallen or been thrown from a train. The Merstham Tunnel, on the London-to-Brighton line, is approximately one mile long, and some time before midnight on September 24, 1905, a Sunday, Sub-Inspector Peacock, of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who was in charge of a gang of men engaged in relining the tunnel, was walking through when he stumbled over something in the darkness.","T hows Ww the wiwaks of wort peopsie Ahewe W9nA a oe et mk FS Cw ed Gems the ut of fou.d ear, the vevaicr Q roua As hw wer ot Hone wer uot sufFicieur eviderce so Slow Whether Pe ee Fe gk Be Rheciow..

Was it a case of suicide, where some unhappy soul had walked deliberately into the blackness and into the path of some train? This hardly seemed likely, since, when she was examined by a local doctor, the woman, young, small, and rather plump, was found to have her own silk scarf drawn almost tight enough to strangle her, and the ends thrust in her mouth like a gag.","tT VM Se ee a ee Ce cs Te DO ee eee ere He sent word Streugh+ away to hear-by Mersthoum Stochion | and a stretcher party took the body +o the Feathers Hote? to await identification.

f04-079.png,"Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising, and there were other injuries on her body which had occurred before her death was ensured by some train which had roared through the tunnel. There were no letters or papers found on her to assist identification, no money, and no railway ticket. By then reports were being gathered about all traffic over this stretch of line, but no information was forthcoming about any carriage with an open door, nor any passenger reporting an incident which might relate.","Both lhe wrists bore the mats of severe bruising oud there were other injuvies on her bdy which had occurred before her death was ensured by some tron which had rowed through the tumel.

f04-083.png,"So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head remained a mystery until later the following day. During that time a description of the girl was circulated, and a Mr Robert Money came forward to identify her as his sister, Mary Money, aged twenty-two. The girl, who was described as being ""always bright and jolly,"" had been unmarried, and lived at Lavender Hill, Clapham, on the premises of a dairyman, Bridger, for whom she worked as a book- keeper.","Se tne body of 4nis small al with Ane blue eges aud \ous brown noir in @ bun ox tne bact of Nef Nead Tevained A MAYNery until) later Awe Follow na day, Baring yrnot time a descrighou of tne aic| was circuloted, aud a ur Robert toned came forward to WdembiFy nerag Wi Sictel, Mach Moned aQed tWea-two.

f04-093.png,"At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector was able to identify a photograph of the girl, and he said he had last seen her on platform six waiting to board a train for the short run to Victoria.

f04-096.png,"A guard reported that at East Croydon he had seen what was accepted as the same couple sitting close together in a first-class compartment of the train from London Bridge of which he was in charge. The two could have joined this train by taking one from Victoria and changing at East Croydon. He also believed that they had still been together at South Croydon, and he remembered that when they reached Redhill, after passing through Merstham Tunnel, a man who might have been the companion of the girl had left the train.","A muord peporled treat at Cart Croydon he had seem who woo aeeepled ay the a (ry-Lerr compartmrot of Mo bray from Senden Bridge of which Re was an chorgye Wee lwo could Yona joined Ws teats by toBrvre eden, Viedora oad drowging oh Cat Croydon. hs aloe believed Mok Vay Yod bl been logeton oA Sort Croylen aud he remumberre "
f04-100.png,"Medical evidence established that Mary Money had been dead for about an hour before her body was discovered, and this matched reasonably well with the timetable of the train in question. More important evidence came from a signalman at Purley Oaks, who had seen, as the train passed his box, a couple struggling in a first-class compartment; but he seemed to have been used to seeing couples engaged in close embraces, for he had not attached any importance to the scene at the time.",Medical prrdence vtakkifed bret Mary Morey had been dead fer ahaut on howe efore hav body wad Aicevered Hae tematotte of Va trem rn guertinr .

John Philpot, one of that new class of merchant financiers which the city of London was now producing, fitted, equipped and manned a fleet from his own resources, and captured the young Mercer in a brilliant Channel fight.","A Stott rh bnylt — Sie Fre Mercer - was Unprts omen ‘a Leston , Hit fou 3. reve, was Auceying Ego ebbing as fer amy an Cher houeg onl deity ob sto some pucpoe Hm Pola , ove °f that now let of merchaut Anancier S heh ye Cty of tule ek Per descing fibed 2pui ied amd manned at Llert frm AN own, anol Guy forth He Mowy Werar mm @ besl[davt — Chamel flyer, LS bwrers "
g01-004.png,"It was naturally a highly popular victory with the Londoners, but it brought heavy censure from nobles who still believed that they had a monopoly of leadership.

g01-008.png,"Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This involved the dreary method of mining operations in which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown considerable skill at the siege of Limoges.","Obedient to He policy of lis Kring, de Uienne avowed trouble of Sea as Clevely an Du Guesclin ccverded it on land.

g01-012.png,"When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised the Earl of Arundel, who at that moment had charge of the mine; the mine collapsed, and with it Gaunt's hopes of fame and glory. Gaunt was compelled to return to England a disappointed and now even despised failure. The 'ribald' Londoners, who cursed Gaunt as the murderer of Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment at the non-arrival of booty, and comparing the failure of a subsidized duke with the independent success of a London citizen."," wou att deed YO 66 on wee 9 gorthe Dui prided) wowout Ladd) che of @ Umue ; He \Usue Coftapaee! fou aud ger. faut WIP COWpette!

g01-016.png,"These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide obvious morals for those who are judges long after the event. It seems obvious that, though the longbows of yeomen could pierce the plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant battle was no substi- tute for a sound policy, and that, if archers had no target, campaigns became mere marauding route marches.","These ary yeara of inefeHe figtiog pro vide obvm9 wort? for hove Wo ve ome bug afk Ho abut. jeeur obiievo tot, Hast he touylOw? of yeouuoe could! mere. 160 plate quo! wat of Frou, Cuhitd a Ln Mnf tale po 4 aubdhtve for a Aue joey, aol Hat avoleo tal uw erp, coy gu hock = We Haruhi rovle (uafolon.

g01-019.png,"It seems obvious that if an expedition to Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais, then the primary essential to the success of the French war was a navy in unquestioned command of the Channel. It seems obvious that divided forces were dissipating the advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bor- deaux and Bayonne, and that there was no hope of final victory without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.","It deem obviova Mat if Wu Cr p00 770, tb iy We coujpeltcl fo vteck vir (laa teu to pruay CSeuhy © He succeo of Ho Feucl. unl wio a voy & UWnpveohey COLL / of fo hawal t ®ewo ofnioys ar dink fran wee App ycahie shy aclu tafe of ari of AON hide wtiyck, iacluol Calorg (Tey foues , 5icot Popa suo/ , auol feat +09€ thy 12 toe AF fist Victorty witout Carpe “Scala aud coudubyalel Uvaarpy.

g01-022.png,"But none of these deductions were drawn at the time, because large-scale war required money, and the citizens who had the money were not yet sufficiently at one with nobles and King to think their money well spent in financing a ruling class which despised them. The Commons were glad enough to enjoy the fruits of victory, they were not so eager to advance the needs of dynastic or baronial wars or even to provide the means for economic war, largely because it was not yet established that those who supplied means should also have control of ends.","But Mowe Of THESE DEDUCTIonsS WERE Vahiwe AT THE TIME, BEcAusE LwReE- SCALE WAR REQUIRED Money, ANd THE .

g01-027.png,"In appreciating this story, modern conceptions of governmental duties must be set aside. A modern government needs taxation not merely for defence and offence but for a very wide range of social services. A mediaeval oligarchy needed taxation in order to supplement the private wealth of the monarchy (the royal income from the revenues of crown lands, the fees of feudalism and the fines of justice) and to provide enough cash to meet royal expenses, and especially the expenses of waging war.","ln Apprecia tyne this Story , modern CO«- Ce ptions of government] dutiag must set aside.

g01-031.png,"Social service as a function of government was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its substitute was the mutual self-help of communities, whether those communities were monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was therefore in essence a forced payment whose return was the uncertain bounty of booty and the vague advantages of military glory; it was therefore always granted grudgingly and coupled with the vain hope that, in the words of Parliament after Parliament, the King might 'live of his own resources and carry on his war'."," Socio/ service os a ftunchon of government? wos guite ahen to mediaeval thought - its substitute wos the meutue/ ‘self-help of communrtes , wether those communrtes were monasteries, manors, townships, er wards and guito!s of a ety.

g01-034.png,"When 'his' war did not bring victory and booty, a new group of Lords might oust the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons, who usually supplied the hard cash, might be bold enough to demand the production of accounts, and even at times the impeachment of the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not the people, and even a full Parliament was not yet a true mirror of the nation.","When ‘his’ war oho not bring victory Qqnd booty, @ new group of Lords rag ht oust the unsuccesstul feaders , and the Commons / who usually supple’ the hard cash, might be bol enough +o demond rhe produchon of aecoun?s, and even at +imes the impeachment? of the unsuccesstul.

g01-037.png,"The people - Langland's 'folk' and Gaunt's 'knaves' - were villeins still tied to the feudal obligations of work or villeins who had bought their release, free labourers who worked for the highest bidders, free yeomen who had prospered enough to become successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen, journeymen and small tradesmen of the towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms in the pay of landed Lords.","The people ~ Langlands Yolk’ ond Goun/ss ‘knoves’- were wvilleens shll hed +o +e feudlo/ oblig otions of work or vitfeins who had bought their refease, tree /obourers who worked for +he hig hest bidleers, free yeomen who had! prospeced enough +o become successful farmers, the orhsons, craflsmen, youreymen ond small fraclesmen of +he towns , and the refomers and men-oar- arms in the pay of landed Lords. "
g01-039.png,"None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or expected to pay direct taxes. Dur- ing the fourteenth century, the traditional methods of financing the Exchequer had become stabilized. When the King and his Council required additional funds, they were usually granted an export tax on the wool trade, collected by means of that 'sta- ple' system which ensured that prices, quality and tax could be efficiently supervised and controlled, together with a subsidy or tax on all movable property.","Man of ththe clane, cnc (lu yeorhen, flarel or waptdbel ro pay airtel yarecs “ (he lores - Hint hat |. te badihiand neftoe, of fyaauy tte Ivechtamer hal become pobte, Whin td ky anot hq (ermal woul alto fol, [eniels, - wtte— “a iP an oryod tart an =+At wot wack, colle Heol by nas of tar ‘aa pl Ayphetr whi cle carer bok pret, pantie aaa Kua (WMO be efriuty Pt - pavit ay contd, yopetbity wa a "
g01-043.png,"There were two other sources of public revenue - first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead of the Commons and in its own Convocations granted equivalent contributions, and second, the foreign merchants, with whom the King's officials had formerly made private bargains at 'colloquies of merchants', and whose payments were now authorized by parliamentary sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in excess of the rate for native merchants.","The nit We oly you of pa bGr c revintw ~ Lift , tht chitich, whiock wt Atly Lollowtd th beat of the (omens and i 4 own Comocedans [Oe Guile, coufrbupot , enot-A cot, Pte mechents, which whom the hiy's Yfpanly hoef wae prods darparid of Clay sts of mnths"", anot who poy Wir now cunthonttel py portiamentny Janch wr af a ron (ovplily Ajby pe ctf ulin of AL oN lor nahbt mtrchaug "
g01-045.png,"In addition to these revenues, the King had the financial benefits of his position at the head of the feudal system, as its chief landowner and the recipient of the fines of royal justice. It was, therefore, a complicated and not very satisfactory financial system in which the borders between private and public purse were as ill-defined as the borders between private and national war, and in which the comparatively simple obligations of the feudal pyramid were becoming hopelessly involved with the complex bonds of trade and industry.","n adllibron 0 Hire reruns Yad a“ had th Loud belfry of hej poutian oltde heat of the ferolat fyphem, as 4 hel, lancouneyy arin, he regia of Hy foild of saged fete Ut nog, Cttrfort, @ campleatel anol 107 tery dabipaderg france jylhin i wtath 40 borolrt = between pore am publ UHL Wer av tt difjue ay Me booly bifwan provad and nabonat wer, ao wn while thd compared. ey pumple Me foctrond of te facta pyamuel "
g01-067.png,"But this time there was a very interesting attempt to apply a sliding scale to the payments demanded. The definition of an adult was altered to read 'over sixteen', and, where the poorest were to pay a groat, the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks, and between these two extremes a graduated scale of payments was fixed for the different classes of laymen and clerics.","Ret Hus ime Here war a veny thleneshty alemnedt fe appl, a sliding scale fe the poy ments Aemandeol.

g01-070.png,"Again the resentment was widespread and the results disappointing - a tax estimated to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000. In the following year, 1380, the last and most notorious third poll-tax was agreed by a Parliament which met at Northampton. There were dark reasons for a meeting so far away from the capital in a town with poor communications and not over supplied with hostelries and lodgings.","Na Ae Slatin! wns wicke spel ibe Hs resotts A’sappotahng —a bea eshinratea bo pelt $0,000 in Pact raised only 22,000. a, Hoe Aimeliik.

g01-074.png,"London was again in turmoil; but this time over a question of trade rivalry. A rich merchant from Genoa had been murdered, and John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was one of those charged with the crime. It is clear from the chronicles that this was a sordid quarrel between monopolists and interlopers. The city merchants were jealous of foreign merchants who could tempt court and baronage with rarer luxuries than those within the scope of English traders, and whose prices could not be controlled in the interests of the city rings.","London war again in turmoil; bad this {me over a quesh'on of trade rivalry.

g01-083.png,"A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure to mediaeval eyes. It was deter- mined that 100,000 was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied the remainder. The method of assessment to which the Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest injustice of this method had been to a certain degree corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax, but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult had to pay three groats, but this time an adult was re-defined as anyone over fifteen."," AA dum of db0,000 ber clemoucel - ¢ Sogpering frou Yo mtct’oeiel ays.

g01-088.png,"Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple arithmetic which argued that, as the first poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of three times the rate would produce 66,000. The only concession made in view of the objections to the first two poll-taxes was the suggestion that the rich should help the poor - but this was only a pious hope because no machinery was provided for carrying it into effect, and a subordinate clause went far to nullify what small effects it had - no man and wife together were to pay more than twenty shillings, a restriction which applied to the generous rich as well as to the mean.","Santen) Pa tela pn wminth ak oy a-ring be thor deel ane ag, ent Eel inane Rha elie wet ylme bo ooo pee ae a ee Pre wry — La Kis Momo eo - sige role: ail ond + pbealinette: "

g02-062.png,"At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three to the movement of the arteries, likewise gauged from the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the ventricular content.","At one anol the same fime, therefore occur the beaf of the apex, the Puckening of the heart walls, and the forcible expulsion of their contained 6lood éy the contraction of the ventricles.

"
g02-065.png,"Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is thus synchronous with cardiac systole but, when movement of blood through arteries is hindered by compression, infarction or interception, the more distal arteries pulsate less because their pulse is nothing other than the impulse of the blood entering them.",Acker pulsar \en disappears with cessa hon of vent ryculat cartfacton .

In 1910 Dr. Talbot was translated to Winchester, and Dr. Hubert Burge became Bishop of Southwark.","ey, fell proud oa ncfok, mace ae Wentel when Ke hiker do he er K — dekrreol “| (- Cam i hits Bvturse : We meng fect be tl ge eee Oe & Ld, a a (rn tuck con ll at pre aap rec'e de oh ne ad Holt f- isev ob esr bth Cr us mse newly pyes : he Auto Dr, fale ft Wao ioithd ds Windle hs oy Dios et, a fu der £ end Dr, Ute "

g04-017.png,"It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play. The place and its people were to play an important part in my life. For five years in succession till war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays there and became very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between the Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be performed at the small theatre in the village, when new talent would be discovered and trained.","fae wh Saree ct Lolafabe Wal f ford wit Olmnrogs im Basen be wba Yh amin Wap.

g04-022.png,"After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit Germany for ten years, by which time in 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey. Towards the end of my five and a half years' incumbency I was asked if I would start a village choral society and conduct it. This opened up a new interest, and we plunged into it.","Tl al wl Afes te foal Wedd ie At, 7 : L Whee Stine. om er Loe eT dk « 2 A: (ereck pens de?

g04-026.png,"First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had any idea of reading music. This was the village doctor who was an old school friend at Clifton. He could sustain the tenor part quite well and lead the others. As for basses and altos the conductor had to teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women could render simple part-singing tolerably well.","Joo AW sinfh pub-amge + T fod al ene minder ole be dey, tx de mecdicn ence He tow: Wa ily, ah ade dees LA rthact Pind ab CO. fe coal sucbm We benon punt quale well and Lead He oll la [lr omen ond alr He combuclar Bad ls head f ringing HR fur a wong amaning, and by Be nchl & Pee coll, om selenide air of mom sock samen could verde scmglh yank ringing, blerallly well "
g04-032.png,"Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's 'Hiawatha's Wedding Feast.' Enthusiasm grew, and in a few more months we gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster, and the tenor solo 'Onaway awake' was sung by the Rector. Friends from Limpsfield, in addition to the villagers, came up, and we were all happy.","th. sn: nek ie hgh me al fa! nad | CQ doe toler 4 Resale ‘s “4 a 2... qe, amd im a pu Moe IR, ~~ oe cat ok whi IR AC coms anol Mt \n villas hata. amd \h Luan ade Cnanaty 4.

g04-036.png,"IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as Vicar of St. Mark's, Woodcote, Purley, a new church built by the well-known architect Mr. George Fel- lowes Prynne, who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was later on joint executor of his estate with his solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held great family consultations.","In 1913 Dv.

g04-039.png,"My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with his family, and found a very s uitable house nearby where my mother settled, and eventually died in 1926 at the age of 92. Dr. Burge was not able to be present at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's. This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich, Dr. John Leake, who lived at Blackheath, and was a close friend of ours.","My eet Grothe, war then Living in Limpslictd with hiy fomi€y, and found a very silage howe neavéy where my mothey sedtled, and eventuatly died in 1996 at the age of 99.0+ Burge was not age bo Ge present ak the \nshidubion and \nduction Service in St. Mawkey. 7 i ew by the Suck Frag dn Bishop of Wookith, Dy John Lewke » who fived at Blackhedth, and was ao clase biend of ous, "
g04-043.png,"But what a change from the dear little old church at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the church was, it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries had been a House of Prayer. I could not but feel the chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is. When we had found a group of people who gladly co-operated, we made the little side chapel a place of daily prayer.","Bur what oa chanag From the deur Usale old church at latsheld to the arent ryodern church of St. Marks Or Valles , Owe FRx ax Gosfield thot smal ag she Churoy was, It had HS own atwosphere,and for centuries had been a lhuse of Frayer.

g04-048.png,"I suggested to the congregation that it needed warming up by constant prayer and worship, and we found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar - helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary for prayer and quiet. In time we received similar gifts for the High Altar, and large East and West windows.","a Suggested +o the Congregation thar i+ needed Warming up by constant prayer ond WONShip , ound we Found many +o hee | Gites of candlesticks and Starved -qMass Lancet windows - final a new oltar- heQeed to Yume Aone Chapel as a Caake SaNctUOMy tor Rrager ond Quiek. \n Ame We Yecewed similar qikks Yor Ane Khar Moe and Varga Last ano West Windows.

g04-052.png,"It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling such a beautiful building with suitable fittings; I made a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to the architect, himself a fine artist. It is quite possible to put beautiful things into a beautiful church and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsuitable to the environs.","Le was very interesting to have the povibeae og Alding Such o beauhzur buidding with suitoke AHings: T-mode a wile ald gifts shadd be submitted soc approval to the archikect, himselg a fine arhst.

g04-055.png,"We also had a little Mission Hall leading off the Brighton Road, in a street full of small houses. This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went there, but was soon changed into the better-sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There were lots of children there, and we had a flourishing Sunday School and an evening service. I soon saw that the parish needed more help both at the church and Mission district.","We adso had a Oo Misson Hole Lending of F the Beghton Read ,in a sleeet pull of smal hower This was coded C2Qon Awenue when I frst went thece, but was soon Changed into the better - Soy naling mau of Lansdowne fog There aan were Lots OF childeon tece, and we had a oui shing Sundlay Sheol aad Gn even ing sernce, L 5201 saw tuor the pacish neeplesl moe help both ot the Ma chk ond hb Sines, distacg.

g04-060.png,"The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the Lansdowne Road district, but I needed more help in the church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays. Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in 1913 soon after I had come, and he organized the Mission district and got to know, and be known by, many of the people of the parish.","The Church Ariny Captain had done very qood work im sha Lansdowne Rood district but | needed rmore help in the churdy for aha. full rota ot semices on Sundays ond weekdays.

g04-063.png,"A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following year, 1914, when war broke out. Very soon Chaplains for the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly that one of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did not wish me to go then, as I had barely been in the parish for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and was very soon in France where he did splendid work until his health broke down and he had a bad attack of enteric fever.","A great bla» dislrucbed all car orks im ahe {oblooing year, 1d when war brote out.

g04-068.png,"Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much co-operation especially with the other Christian communities. At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the 'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committees I found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help wives and relations of the soldiers to get their 'Separation' allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties began and increased in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions became very urgent, and I was asked to be Chairman of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.","Meanwhile iy Purley Mhere was much activity and mudh Co-operation espectally with the other Ghiistan Communities, Ara lurge gubolic meching We launched the groiect Known as the takedown and Hurley Prtvlotte Fung?in Whose Counsel s and Commitees .

g04-072.png,"Indeed, for the next seventeen years, during my time at Purley, and from 1922 at Surbiton, I was continuously Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee. This task involved a very great deal of detailed work for the Committee. We had a splendid body of local residents, and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries. Our Committee met once a week in the evenings, and included professional men from every walk of life.","\ndeed No: the nek+ seventeen yeas during my Hme oct Kaley, and from 4822 eet Surbiton! ets Continuously Chairman of the lod War Bnsions Committee.

g04-077.png,"Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen. Life was in those years more than busy. We now had a vicarage next to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the church.","Mery loon we managed Go yee a artin Purley where Sbdiacs were very weltone and He Ladies 0: gouized a carceen Li fe was in Eoce jeacs weve Glan busy We now had avicarage nexe an Che Chuwch, and | wer wore forennoee ve bce we for eight years a ose able aul devored house keeper Whom | had kwown wel in Livapsfiebd Where Sue had w horte rexeto Lhe Cbarcedn.

g04-081.png,"On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to Purley she offered to come and look after me.

g04-088.png,"We gathered together a splendid Sunday afternoon service at the church, each child being given a number which, as they came into church, they could just whisper to the superintendent who filled in the register at her own home. Each child had a picture given them and the lesson was largely based on this. It was on a stamp which could be stuck in their book, and there was quite a clamour for back stamps if a child had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause which the Vicar considered justifiable!",We BWdshePes NGASSAS?

I hope the threat kept them good in the week, but anyway they were a most delightful lot, and it is a great joy to meet them now fifty years afterwards when so many are parents or even grandparents, and one of the present churchwardens and several officials of the church still remember those days.","lew oO Warcse ssn, 40 see how He dy she WIMDFEN aH Joyes Ake SPA aHd |) LGA of Yarenkg ok FAKED wols@s ahrearen dag nasybry de Wick RHQ RamahdA§ oo nod Mioweh so come to she Chdbdves Gulch o\ SANJAY ARARFNOOM , \ Wot kg HR Nala eR Nhe Good NHR HAAK UL.

g04-095.png,"Speaking of churchwardens and children leads me at once to chronicle a most intimate and lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and continuing till old age to-day. When I went to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F. W. Charlton and his family, the youngest of whose three sons was just coming into the world in this year of 1913.","Spurling 1 hcl iadet and dhl hee wt hime bk cbmwicle 4 mmd indeate and oe die dokiy bean Mea Pate ca ee LU od ene bole. dthem F wttinke ee Mids dt fot cruel A mle aa ore Warden Hr Fb. thy hbo and. he fen4 a ee 7 a. ica Aenw4 Lia, er 1. ae He bu wl ie H., oa | A442.

g04-098.png,"From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very deep friendship which I have taken with me through all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry. Mr. and Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult years of war, when most lives were upset and some tempers were easily frayed, the most loyal and devoted friends.","From them GM now the cuqvaiatauce ripened into a ver dleep fnendship which + have taken with ma thaugh oY te aes viassitudes of a bog mina virg fle and Ne.

g04-101.png,"Their homes - for since those years they have lived on in Purley - have always been havens of rest, and the welcome has never failed.

g04-104.png,"In those early years 1914-18, life was very full both in the parish and in the wider war activities. The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in Bavaria, asked me if I would do something for two wards at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners. I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them frequently, establishing at once a friendly contact with the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find someone who knew their native villages.","i [rote con Cy ques M3ty 8 Gh wen ey [LL both ass en: pas ma ~~... wickes Wary ctu te . a.

g05-094.png,"The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing more than a fantasy. Thanks to the good sense of the front line soldiers, the meeting of East and West was marked by the use of no weapon more lethal than vodka.

g07-018a.png,"It may have been then that Trelawny contrived to do his copying. Considering that Pietro was not above twenty-three years of age when he undertook a load of heavy responsibilities, his conduct reveals him as one of the most intelligent as well as the most sympathetic of Byron's 6entourage in Greece. With his good looks - for he 'carried the passport of a very handsome person' - his good manners and his perfect lack of pretension, he even succeeded in disarming Hobhouse's possessiveness and making him forget how deeply he had disapproved, less than two years ago in Italy, of the immoral way the Countess Guiccioli's family accepted Byron as her lover."," may have been hen Yra\ Tralawny conivived to de ne Copying.

Quite apart from the divagations of her 'poor brother' - so she constantly referred to him - there were a hundred reasons why it would be objectionable to have the family history exposed.

She had lived down the rumours which had made the year of the Byron separation a nightmare to her, and she had also succeeded, though with an increasing sense of effort, in persuading her little world to avert its eyes from her husband, 'that drone', as Byron called him, whose career of devotion to the turf was reputed to have a certain shadiness.","WA war mo nue pltaroaut fer Fue ton.

g07-071a.png,"There were few things in Augusta's whole life, full of calamities though it was, that hurt her more than this contemptuous slight from George Anson Byron, whom she had loved with an unswerving loyalty, and had looked on as her intimate friend. Moreover, he was without the right to make such pronouncements: he had inherited nothing from her brother but his title, whereas she was not only of nearer consanguinity but the chosen recipient of his property.","———- Vee SS es OU: Ee UL ee Life, Pull of calamities though it was, thor hurt her more than this contemptuous g light trom Geofge Ansor Byroa, whom she had loved with an uswerving loyalty , and hod looked on as her intimate Fiend.

"
g07-074a.png,"These, if she had only known it, were precisely the reasons why her cousin took pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her. Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have intimate friends, and in every instance where the occasion was granted her, she managed to find some excuse for bestowing, in whole or in part, those confidences which never failed to leave her audience agape with wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's wickedness.","These, it Sne naa ONY KNOUW IT, Wee precisely the ceasons why hor coosin took pleasore in the opportunity of Annoying hot.

g07-077a.png,"George Anson Byron had seen enough of the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband to be aware that Augusta, so far from being responsible for the collapse of the marriage, had been Lady Byron's greatest support and comfort at the time; but it had been deemed necessary all the same to enlighten him as to the suspicions in the background, and he had repeated them to his newly married wife.","George Anson foyron NOA keen Lough oF {ne poet's atrocivs conduct as a husband lo be aware that Augusta , So for from being responsible for the collapse of the marriage , MAA been lady Byron's gteatest Support and comfort at the time; but it had been deemeol Necessary all the Same bo enlighten him as to the sospicions in the backgrond, and he had repeated them to lis nguly mained wife. "
g07-079a.png,"Their friendship for Augusta became rather hollow, and the news that Byron had left her practically all his money caused it to crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron knew perfectly well that Byron, as early as the year of their wedding, 1815, had made a will in Augusta's favour, she had evidently not passed on that information; and it came as an appalling surprise to Captain Byron that he had been left without the fortune that would keep up the title.","CO DECOM rove Zoaar riendaAn ed PME - ~ 7 ROWA oI Daye ad at per practically oS Kos nmontey commd K Vo ytrmble Vo oblivion. 4yough Lody Baron knew pargacdhy wd Nyok Byrn, ah cork, By Khe Maor of Vina weddamay \B\S5 hod ise gn ek Pe quatoa® Loveur , A. 2Videwy, a pariady on eal Lagoremallion; And © come or on opedling Amerprirs Veo Caglaw Barm Vhok oe hod bern byt Who Ae Rolin hel” would Kenp Luo The . eee "

The former had asked for marriage details for all married women, the latter for all married women under the age of 50. The 1961 Census questions related to all women who were or had been married, and so repeated the enquiry made fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family Census conducted on behalf of the Royal Commission on Population.","Blattion hous mange mo Lilobren Wee apan enki cleat, ac Haug Rat heen ad he Onn Ana ANT Coutate , He forme Ral albhog fa Aaonrae blob, far 4 tranre Veta. fon Cotter for ate wramed VYouen sno Ken ape of 00.

h01-007.png,"The innovation at the 1961 Census, though the Family Census had previously included the question, was the date of termination of the first or only marriage. This enables statistical use to be made of their experience as regards duration of marriage and number of children in the case of women whose first or only marriage was terminated by widowhood or divorce after the end of their child bearing life.","TRe annovation W He “861 wus Moupk he Fenty Crauns Lact Preview [hy puch.

h01-010.png,"This is particularly important in estimating the trends in the size and pattern of families for successive generations over as long a period as possible, as the proportion of widows predominates in the higher age groups. In Wales and Monmouthshire the question on the ability to speak Welsh was included as previously.

In 1961 the scope of the question was wider than before, because of the great use of the data to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and to local authori- ties. As before, the record made during the enumeration lists all buildings, residential premises and temporary places of abode, and all households occupying them, as the basis of the enumeration is the household schedule.","Koch consus since he Krst in ARON lar incliclee! queshions chou housing ate households.

h01-027.png,"Previously, while visitors were left out of this analysis it was not considered sufficiently important to attempt the task of bringing in the members away from home on Census night, which would be very laborious in the absence of information given at their place of usual residence. But the need for a more accurate distribution of households by size as usually constituted had become more important by 1961, and accordingly a new question was introduced, for private households only, asking for particulars of persons usually living in the household who were absent on Census night.","Premnously, while visitors weee left out of thas analysis it way not cowsidereol suffrertuthy waporfaut 10 atfenpt tax task of bring ing in Me ucenbes auwray frowr howe on Cem tnght, urbich woulol be vesey labors i'n absece of tn forwenna trie gine at Merr place of usual resrolence (a logn).

We decided as a first step to seek information from a number of organisations and persons having an interest in the questions before us and at a later stage we arranged for publication of a press notice inviting anybody interested to submit representations. We compiled a list of the points which we thought were of importance, but we made it clear that the replies need not be confined to these particular items.","We have held eleven meehngs.

h02-012.png,"3. On 23rd November, 1959, we submitted an Interim Report. This dealt with two questions which arose from our terms of reference and which had been brought specially to our notice. First, we were asked to examine the risks attending the abuse of carbromal and bromvaletone and preparations containing these substances. The Poisons Board had already considered this problem but, in the absence of sufficient evidence that these compounds were widely abused, had not recommended them for control as ""poisons"" under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933.","On rd oowmbir SY, gor WbhMikladk a “Sabian, Zaperk.Thos dal orth Jose Qass\hords WTS) BOAR Yen GF [MA Oh WOK og. whit Tad ian Miongitk Spray 8 Mar NEMA “Husk, ax codsd aalad So jxomina Wa tits ONIN dug Wu WovKr oh caslyromak and LraMuahAenn Ghd Ppatranr Capnesciig WRAL sudaloncar.

h02-017.png,"4. On examination of the evidence it became clear to us that carbromal and brom- valetone were examples of a number of drugs on sale to the public which were not appropriate for restriction to supply on prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951, or the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1956, and had not so far been recommended for control as poisons.","¢ bu cratiapou of The Lyhuce FP becawe Cclerr fo us That Cadialal aul Lowlalesme sere exawuples Gf a puuby of dug gu kale i te public shih Atte bot he Mel yr [ition fo ‘yy gu fleleryeliae tide Tht Lipgegos Ing 1 fer, /N7, ao Wee Thitapeutic debitavecs Pet, (ME, aud fad pot vo far betu recounmertticl fr conthel ag fawoldl.

h02-019.png,"5. We recommended that, in general, any drug or pharmaceutical preparation which as an action on the central nervous system and is liable to produce physical or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply on prescription and that an independent expert body should be responsible for advising which substances should be so controlled. 6. As an interim and urgent measure, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, on the recommendation of the Poisons Board, has made Rules under which certain substances having an action on the central nervous system are included in a new list of substances which may be sold by retail only on the prescription of a duly qualified medical practitioner, registered dentist, registered veterinary surgeon or registered veterinary practitioner.",veterinary surgeon or registered veterinary practitioner.

h02-022.png,"7. We are glad to note the action that has been taken and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure that, as other preparations affecting the central nervous system become available, they too will be brought to the notice of the Poisons Board, or such other advisory body as may in due course be appointed for the purpose, to consider whether there are sufficient grounds for restricting any of them also to supply on prescription.","and We Wye Mok oxcranteamentes will be wedkr to answer Mak, as ote Pigpratens oRechinng Tho comtrnl wortous Syst Leome ovodwole AWey oc ww be brows So Te vce of the Poisove Boend oF Such Chor adubety lbedy AG way in due comse be Appoiuber) foe Pre prurpese, Fo covsider Whathar there ove sufficiews rounds for vestriching any of them also to supply Ow presciip hen "
h02-024.png,"8. The second part of our Interim Report was devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted to the gases and vapours which they use in the course of their professional duties.

h02-028.png,"9. We were assured by our expert witnesses on this subject that, with the apparatus at present to hand, the preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before administering them to a patient was a recognised and necessary precaution. We accepted this. 10. In view of the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be entrusted with their administration.","\We were assured by our expert witnesses on thk subject that, with the apparatus at present fe hard, the perlimiinary sniHing of the gases immediotel, before.

h02-035.png,"11. The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee, whose advice we were invited to review, were to advise on: (a) the circumstances, if any, in which the supply of mor- phine and heroin, and preparations containing these substances, to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded as medically advisable; (b) the precautions which medical practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any administrative measures that seemed expedient to secure observance of those precautions.","THE Mart LOEKS of AOE Lolleskon ComM*ieo _ whos OOvic2 WE We inviiad 46 Teva, WAe CALiIaG Of: (a) Ane CKCUMNSAANAZE | aay , 18 wick tz mely of Mot Pune Ana hefow\ asd epacodions COMOAMINA, LOZezZ Sushanazs, Xo eexacts addicl2d +o svose ATLAS tran ve K2qatded OS NAO Cooly odvisodla ; ('0) kz EGzcowdions wich) medica|| prockwiones APM VshaE NO, or PISsem dio) Morphin oF HELIN chould adopt 40 avoid OWLEZ and any COMIMATOAWE Mansur Irot seemed exezdiom te CIO ORREXVANC of hose eTzcaukoNs .

h02-037.png,"12. Through the system of records and inspection then in operation cases were brought to the notice of the Home Office at that time in which exceptionally large quantities of morphine and heroin had been supplied to particular practitioners or pre- scribed for individual cases. On further enquiry it was ascertained that sometimes the doctor had ordered these drugs simply to satisfy the craving of the addict; in some in- stances there was a doubt whether the supply was for 6bona fide medical treatment; in other cases the drugs had been prescribed in large quantities either to persons previously unknown to the practitioner or to a patient receiving supplies elsewhere; occasionally, large supplies had been used by practitioners for self-administration.","Ae Tite ou gf tle sy stern eA eee g.2 inspec hon then bx yper ahem C2ses Cee € hvoveg&é . tle eles if (le Mere ffi i Ke ad bce LA A seco plies ally | ar Aa = i. o-7 Mo- : ¢ au 7 eee lege quails of mec phe bewe bod beer reppled fo pebreular puach. ee fises On Mig brn geirg “ taret mp Ce a ied eh Jha la Dad, ou heed Jhese deogs J fy hey oe ; P ; "
h02-040.png,"13. It appeared then that in some circumstances dangerous drugs were being supplied in contravention of the intention of Parliament that a doctor should be authorised to supply drugs only so far as was necessary for the practice of his profession. Before deciding on measures to secure proper observance of the law, it was felt necessary to have some authoritative medical advice on various aspects of the treatment of addiction, the use of dangerous drugs in medical treatment, and the action which might be taken where a doctor appeared to have misused his authority to possess and supply them.","AE fl appealed Hey Sth}. eee 0 1 terpboute Meuge oud ag8 wee Ley, ve cuppliedl rea Cov tlaverctor. of Me /uhuttor of larliatueut tte? a abchor Sliutt Cb A2v/Gon@A 7 Sits hug otuty So fel AFP wWaS weceSary for tlre.

h02-043.png,"14. The Rolleston Committee's recommendations in 1926 on the supply of morphine and heroin to addicts to these drugs and on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed later in this Report. They have, up to now, been included in the Memorandum on the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations which is prepared by the Home Office for the information of doctors and dentists.","~- Mhe Cle toute cent lee t Pabates ce. 4926 gee be seg ply 6 curgheie Qe flores tr akhicls tr Lew Liegs aul oe Ke torte A heey 1. eatin < 22 Alycerrre- bode pi 428 Wert Pag fave, igo & burr, bare 2 Beek 2s Ke (bemoan oe he Dauyp mor Leg Ack aucl Cgercthioes wake om pat srantce fy He flacue Office pr be Aafrenabiaw 24 Berton auc feulerts .

h02-049.png,"(2) The Secretary of State was empowered, on the recommendation of a tribunal, to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor, or a doctor convicted of an offence under the Act, should not issue prescriptions for dangerous drugs. (3) It was made clear that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified medical practitioner when required for purposes of medical treatment.","The Jechetary of Shh wad Cmpouertd , Ont Keommenrtohion of tribuccl ho untadraw c doctor J Guthorty to Passed and Supply ole yeOund Ary and £0 dirtel the yoo « ofoctor , on a doctor connthd of on offenk Unde He Acd , te thoutd vat ue pres cap Ao for dey rows A mys (2) Ho wes made clear theft presenp howd shoud 0 buly he ji sen by a duly qualfud medi'ceh prechowr Wht rg und for purpourt of mes te! tec dived .

h04-000.png,"Nevertheless, average net family income was appreciably higher in families with sev- eral children than in those with only one, many of which were incomplete families of younger parents with lower earnings, and of course with lower tax reliefs and no family allowances. The rise in net family incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great- est for childless couples, especially older couples (probably because of the increase in retirement pensions), and somewhat greater in small than in large families.","Nevertbelrr , ares cet antly nese boar apecials Kighey ¢ joe oy Hy peworel children Yhan ¢n Yhoag wit, ee many f wxtiel, were ‘apehusiott poaeilete "" younger porerte with lower earringe - and course. whth lwor ax relia quof No peril allowances.

h04-007.png,"Compared with 1958, the expenditure index for 1959 showed increases of 4 to 6 per cent for couples without children and those with one child, and much smaller changes for couples with several children. The quantity index, which has risen only slowly since 1956, was almost unchanged in 1959 for couples with two or more children, but rose by 3 per cent in the older two-adult households and by 1-2 per cent for younger childless couples and couples with one child.","Compened wil (958 Hee oxpertibe otee fp O55 Shcevanel CUrcite cr 8e$ of 4 be G (~ ar i: conte, we let MoO Sane. oe oe uate oe ae sal walk: <aeee crop ae conke. uth Sennen! cectidea The.

h04-021.png,"As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent more per calorie than the national average, and families with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only substantial change was in families with three children, for whom the index declined from 91 to 88. Table 27 also shows the corresponding values of an index which com- pares the prices paid by different types of household for the commodities constituting the average household diet in 1959.","Ws oe Last eo Couples pork X00 We 2. he pr ca met fe colour Das: Be went oresek | unin [ace ute “ int tn, eh sadan 1h ~ end to To oy for he-hinnadhiiand Aro Wor Cia (orn srnes , fis Mth. a whom He cde defiant (ou 8 lL &, Tw et ls dann Be. cous (onekinn wince of wag cnale <i Compote the pow (cal b4 Si (Let bape. of Costnatd (br ee cea ee eG. courte em _ Arena (ocd nial din > Shins (9sa *.

As with the price of energy index, the only noteworthy change was for households with three children, in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for all households in the sample.","Gr ald Pode We nansy soee Prom T.6 ger tak alee He nab rae in Younger hae -adall Recs lo 4.8 por cok DoD im fxn al Pour 2 mare Lda, compre vod +3.6 be -5-4 yor cenk om 1354 amd + 1.9 by - 1.6 por cmb im 1987. dhe veil Hh pref vurgy fel We cal, olemenly dnp me for Lora, exit Home bln im oll We indane JO Dy 4-8 bo 97-6 for ck of He cern Pr Chil on Hh. com.

h04-035.png,"Consumption by younger childless couples declined throughout this period, but that of the smaller families was maintained except for the slight fall in 1959. In the largest families, particularly those containing four or more children, there was a tendency for consumption to increase between 1955 and 1957, and thereafter to decline. Graduated scales of family allowances were introduced in October 1956, and the welfare milk subsidy was reduced in April 1957.","“Consumption by yougec childless couples declined — throughout this period , but that of the smallec families was mat nt ai ned except fot the slight Fo|{ in 1954 In the largest families, partite ty those contal mins, For. oc more chi ld Phfie ink a Fond ency fox Cons urmotion te inew@aie bee ase qud theteaf ret to decline.

h04-049.png,"75. The smaller families and the residual groups of households containing children re- duced their consumption of sugar and of preserves, but in all other types of household a decline in purchases of the one was accompanied by an increase in consumption of the other. 76. Most groups spent slightly less on potatoes than in the previous year, but consumption was maintained except in families with more than one child and in the unclassified households with children or adolescents.","BS the smatier Smiter and He reacdal Soups of hose holds conhn re Orldin reduced Hear corsumphon oft Sugar and of preserver but My lt other hy (~ of lhersehtd a decline in paychases of Uy ome wos a Coompaned by an INGERIE 10 Consumnphow of He other. 16.

Purchases of quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extremely wide group differences persisted, the averages ranging from 0.1 oz. per head per week in families with four or more children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult households; average consumption by older couples and other wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head per week.","ALL groups exceo famiies with four or mere chidren or wilh adblescems bid no children consumed. mere fresh green regatables, especially the firs} half eX’ the year, al\\hoaahnt mos\ Veducedl therr consumption of other vege tables. larclases a quick-frozen geas anal beans qererally wcreasedl, bul extreme- ly mole group differences gersisted, the orarages,,fanging Crom O\ oz. ger heaal cer ween Lambes with Kear oe more chidren to 09 oz. oer head w jounger two-adalt heaseholds; average consamplion ly older couples and other Wholky-adu/f hace holes wag 0.5 oz. pear ympeetl per weel,.

The averages showed little change compared with those for the previous year, except for generally increased intakes of vitamins C and D.

In 1959 the households in this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64) than in the previous year (average 4.53). Their total food expenditure increased less than that in other groups, and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish, poultry, eggs, canned vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are more expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which they purchased less, namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat products.","products See Wes Robe eas meer SCSIEQON SOA peaneend RMecenr.

h06-000.png,"To provide fuller information about certain types of dangerous occurrence, Section 65 of the Factories Act, 1937, requires notification of certain specified occurrences to H.M. District Inspectors of Factories, whether or not they result in injury. Appendix 20 gives figures of dangerous occurrences reported in 1960; the types of occurrence which have to be reported are set out in the heading to the Appendix.","Teo proridle Caller in Genel, obant corbul dope of eigen mee Soci 65 = tie Gl A |D3% , vegatves nofificatiog of cove, specified ween te Att Diddel lngeclee of Peclecer nepali ee thes cel be injney Appein: Be ie Gea oe dees eeeeeces terri Ila 5 fle types OE eccererce hich bee Is be tep este “ve cok cake he the L cadne tle Apy coche "

However, the number of notifiable accidents associated with occurrences fell from 252 (31 of them fatal) in 1959 to 245 (22 fatal) in 1960. The main increase in the numbers of occurrences reported occurred in the category of those due to the collapse or failure of a crane, derrick, winch or hoist, where there was an increase of almost one-third from 335 to 438.","ee ee a during dhe yest es 1,409, ay jncreste oF II nee Whe lolol Ger 1959.

h06-082.png,"There is, however, a danger that workers will rely too much on fixed devices because they fail to recognise their limitations. It is therefore safer both in principle and practice to keep the worker away from overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by (1) re-routing the line, (2) putting the supply underground, (3) making the line dead (after consultation with the supply authority), (4) providing barriers at a safe distance to prevent vehicles from approaching the line, or height gauges or ""goal posts"" at points where vehicles must pass below the line, (5) providing look-out men or banksmen.","MMe (5S, Nowwuer, & Asnger Frat boO/ eed will rely too mudi on fixed devices becouse. they foul bs recogni Le their Umilahions.

Manufacturing industry affords employment to large numbers of non-manual as well as manual workers. An analysis made by Crawley Development Corporation in 1958, after collating replies from fifty-eight manufacturing firms employing over nine thousand staff, showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as managerial and administrative, 11 per cent as technical or employed in research and 19 per cent as clerical.","The average grow retum or eta btorbed Crtarteiet atiate tages from FY pe nk of A conlel tener on Ld, emrpheyrmnent Ap Large rumhers ef nom- manusl arwellar mearorl wertets, tranalyars marl hy Crarley Lerclonmi icaene ties i ThE, ole tellin tntene tien ginal phorved ALMA S pet err of Me NAL were cLevid ar rraragerel ond aclerinirtintior, tt percent ar teckmrtral "
h07-007.png,"There is no reason to suppose that this pattern is peculiar to Crawley. The develop- ment corporations have aimed at a varied pattern of industry, offering a reasonable choice of employer as well as choice of occupation for men, women and school-leavers, with due regard to the industries already established in their towns. Inevitably engi- neering, including the motor vehicle and aircraft industries, predominates in all the London new towns since these are among the industries which have expanded most during the last ten years in the country generally.","There Lane reaten te muppet AEX Xhss patlon bo pected 3 Crosley, Tee cleveleprren™ corporations Kaur arned at a varved peter eof rdurtry, offering a mearcnetl Kotce of employer anrortlar Keres of orcunntion fot men rwoermin and nheot - Leavis, wtk Lue regard te Xe mdurtirce, Ameng te Lent Ren year nl county qeruterlly.

On the other hand these groups offer fairly varied opportunities of skilled employment and are highly diversified as regards products, markets and methods of manufacture. Consumer goods industries such as the manufacture of food and drink, tobacco, clothing and footwear are under- represented in the new towns generally though not in Basildon and Welwyn.","Thee fiquns ar mo ligt faa, Wee hotonat Meals, ard Meg be Khsughd- to mica a hack of bahence vin Syme of He wun.

j06-000.png,"All stages of Calanus, for example, seem to migrate on some occasions while any stage may not on others. Such data cannot yet be rationalized. Where information is less extensive, however, it is possible to find some regularity in the observations. Thus in Euphausia superba from the Antarctic, the metanauplii remain in deep water, the later larval stages migrate diurnally, and the adolescents stay permanently at the surface.","NUL Stags or LOlonul, for CXampPh Wein tes migrare Oh SOME OACCOSIOMS White ny Stage may not on others, Such data conned ut be rotionolived.

An echo-producing layer, which the authors think probably consists of euphausiids, has also been described as, in part, regularly moving in a reverse manner.

Many forms sometimes migrate and on other occasions do not, but a few appear to remain permanently at one level.

j06-026.png,"In view of its well-known normal migration, the occurrence of Calanus finmarchicus in the summer at the surface in bright sunlight may justly be considered anoma- lous. This phenomenon has nevertheless been recorded many times, and such surface Calanus may be present in enormous numbers, breaking the surface into small circu- lar ripples like raindrops. Observed underwater, two zones of differing behavior were recognized: an upper one about 30 cm in depth, in which the Calanus swam up and down repeatedly, frequently bumping on the undersurface of the water, and a lower one of indeterminate depth in which animals swam directly up or down.","a of ee Yr rilton, bee ihc of La Cenc {treateretel ang ee cee ‘y getty he eu A720 Oded 5 WA pheremere bras retthelss lea re cov clecl ea Lynes enh auth cowface Cala nus sl be yprevend A, eros MtowhesS, bee Chea. oe Lrlace. dio Sranll acule— ripfles Cle.

j06-030.png,"It seems likely that a continuous interchange was taking place between the population at the surface and that in deeper water. A second group whose normal vertical mi- gration is sufficiently well known to make daytime occurrence at the surface rank as anomalous is the Euphausiacea. There are numerous records of euphausiids swimming at the surface in bright sunshine, with particular mention of their shoaling behavior under these circumstances.","We Lees Lilly Net « econ nuous Vwbercharge was fobals place fetweer fae Population at Me cerfece anetl MAL, Aepty wake A second grip toy ramel jeflicel ontgre Wo SS eff iar ell rvell lrwen fy rite LCA We occurence wt Oa po faee mnie as agrees fe Bupha usiacea. on acumen recards of euph augicds § echavndes "
j06-034.png,"2. Mechanisms. The majority of vertical migrations undoubtedly result from active swimming although passive movement through the water has been suggested on vari- ous grounds. For example, transport in vertical currents resulting from temperature differences has been proposed; differences in water viscosity after temperature changes have also been suggested as a cause of movement, and passive movement could possibly result from changes in the specific gravity of the animals as a result of feeding.","2.

Initiating, controlling, and orienting factors. The primary dependence of diurnal migrations upon changes in light intensity is beyond doubt.

j06-056.png,"Loeb first suggested the importance of light as the governing factor but combined its influence with that of gravity. Later authors, in particular Rose, have proposed that light alone can provide an adequate mechanism if the animals have, and select by exploration, a zone of optimum light intensity. This view has been enlarged with a suggestion that both phototaxes and geotaxes may play a part in keeping animals near their optimum.","ia eee re ike.

j07-000.png,"This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be obtained with tubular constructions. The growth of the aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's, the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction became established for aero-engine radia- tors, using dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages were separated by flat plates.","This resulted in units a much fighter weight than could be obtained with tubular conshuchous.

j07-005.png,"The air passages were packed with corrugated foil bonded to the primary plates to provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer. The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil, chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand the coolant pressure loadings. The introduction of the aluminium alloy dip- brazing process in the early 1940's was quickly taken up for aircraft heat exchangers and led to substantial weight reductions as compared with copper construction.","The aur passages were jovekeol w1th Comupatec/ fol bemolet- Loroled! to the Orimary plakes to- proviole the necessary Surface area for heat tramgfor The narrower Cootant passages were. alsecaches with fol, yy to proviole sigftcieul support for th fll plates to- witstancl sail since Lomaliays Vie Vilhelm ofthe lly razing process inthe carly AV0¢ Wwe quickly fohon yo rirerft heat exchampurs cmol Lol to subctanbial Mt vecluctions as Com pour eo/ cwith Copper conshrechirn, "
j07-009.png,"This development coincided with the introduction of pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer co- efficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger were of comparable magnitude, the use of secondary surface was still attractive, since the greater part of the surface area could be made up of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.","This cevelepmeut colucaded with the iudveducheu of pre Ssurized aircraft Cabins aud the dewoaud for air-to-air cobiu cookers .

j07-012.png,"Furthermore, developments in the detail form of the fins made possible a reduction in the total surface area required as compared with the use of smooth continuous passages for the same thermal duty and pressure losses. The properties of compact form, low weight, and design flexibility thus developed found ready application on a much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage scale air separation plants.","Further urore , Acguelenuents iu the detaik form of the fius made nessible a roluchou in the total sur Coce Nea CKquired as courpared with the use oP for the same thecmal Smooth couk wvous passages ol by aud pressure 4osses .

k04-010.png,"The party was now preparing to see the tapestries, and in the general movement, Vittoria was separated from Orsini. Although neither of them wished to follow the sightseers, there seemed no alternative. As she was about to mount a wide and shallow flight of marble stairs, she became aware of someone watching her intently, and turning in that direction, she saw Olimpia, standing beside her admirer, Orlando Cavalcanti.","We ply tewtonee Pipe ee Pee ot Be eee prover, Vittonn way separctid = fron Ovens.

k04-014.png,"The young man was bending over her with the assiduity of a lover, but the girl appeared to be more interested in her cousin's wife, whom she was regarding through half-closed eyes. This was a slight shock to Vittoria, who had forgotten the existence of the girl, and, up to this moment had been unaware of the young man's presence at the palazzo.","The yung man wes bending over her with the assicluity of a Iver, bik the gur/ appe ered bo be more sikereshed Un her escsiné wile, urhem she wees rageecling Hee augh hal) closed eyes.

k04-017.png,"'Are you enjoying yourself, Olimpia?' she asked idly, tapping the girl's cheek lightly with her fan, in passing; but she did not wait for the answer. Disturbed by vague uneasiness, she was wondering whether Olimpia had been watching her talk with Orsini. Surely she could not have overheard anything they said? A moment's reflec- tion reassured her on that point, for she was certain no one had been standing near them.","Aoz gen enegies oye: a Des lig. aaked dy \ bon a5 ha sinks cheek Cahly wr, hor an, (A feeding j but she Bid aot walt ~* the anawor, Disturbed i vagus uneaainoca , 2AX bx te doen dlecios axhoathor Oenprs ha tttn ; in. ie ; warteluns hoy talk with Oram. hey wg. ml A momontS ofeelie: reassured hor om het ped, e ho wee Gultie 40 om. hak been tented eae Cian.

k04-022.png,"However, something inimical in the girl's look put Vittoria on guard. 'Santa Maria! These spying eyes!' she thought, bitterly. Doria was continually stopping on the way, to point out, with childish pride, objects of beauty or interest. Vittoria, on the fringe of the party, caught snatches of this information, which held no interest for her: '... now this sapphire ...","However, something snimical on He gul & lewk pub Vitteu'e om guard, Soules Haig. t Plex: spyvey “ye | “ she thaw shh, bitterly Drie ures conbin cally Shaping on the wey, Ar pomb ack, with chelelesh peels, dbyecks of heauby or rm beresb Vittava, om bh Junge of the poy, caughh smnakches oh be mf amabion, whech peld ne rbevesh Ja es . nae bh is styphie 2 "
k04-028.png,"I like to think it may have fallen from the dark hair of the Empress Messalina, as she crouched in terror in the gardens of Lucullus, awaiting the sword of the executioner.'

He knew how to deal with an adulterous wife, eh, Orsini?'","Z Like to Sian it may daiien #rom the olark hair oF the Empress Messabfina,as She Crouchedl tn terror in the gardens of lucuilus | awaiting the suorol of the executioner,’ Ah!’ exchaimedl Farnese with oa Snigyer. ’The old cuchokol Claudius had the fast worel, atter avg.

k04-033.png,"If the duke made any reply to this, Vittoria did not hear it. Now they entered the long gallery where they dispersed and wandered around, admiring and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought back from Lepanto. After a short interval, Orsini found an opportunity to rejoin Vittoria. 'We must talk further,' he said in a low urgent voice. 'Where?'","Ef the duke made any reply to this vierorte diol n@t heat it.Jow they entereol the “ong qullery aleve they aliSperseol and wareereol aroundol admiring anol commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric splenlours of the tapestries Dortol hol brought back ¥rom Lepanto, After a Shore interval, Orsint founol an opportunity t0 rejoin Vittoria. ‘We must talk turther, he said in a tw urgent yoice, Where ?

k04-039.png,"'Be careful,' she whispered from behind her fan. 'Olimpia is watching us. The young man with her is Orlando Cavalcanti, Francesco's friend.' Orsini shot an impatient glance at the couple. 'The young man with the mole?' 'Yes, indeed.' 'No matter. They are not looking at us. Now I must know,' he whispered, 'what you meant, cara mia. Do you want your freedom in order to marry?'","‘Be cave Sull’ she whisperect From behinol her Con. ‘Olimpia is watching, us The Your, May with her ‘i Orlando Cavalcanti , traucesco’s Yyrend ’ Opsiut shot om _ olauce dt the cusle The young ma with the role? ae indeed.

k04-050.png,"Before replying to this, she glanced hastily around, then spoke in tones so low that he had to bend his head to hear: 'I will never be any man's mistress.

k04-054.png,"With a swift gesture she closed her fan and moved away from him towards the group in the centre of the gallery, leaving him standing alone, against that glowing, barbaric background, with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face. On a bright unclouded morning a few days after the visit to the Doria Palace, the cardinal's coach left the villa, lurched over the unpaved track and turned towards the ruined Baths of Diocletian.","With a Swile gesture She Closld ner fan and movtd owag from him Cowalre’s éh? group in EhC Cloner? of tne gallery, feaving him standing alone, against Ena€ glowing , barbaric bacrground), wien a decpfy cnoughe buf ex 0p re Ssiorn on his alte on a bright unchonelCo morning a lew Jags ECL one wuisig to En@ Doria Polace, ERP Caloinals Goath tthe th?

k04-057.png,"Vittoria, accompanied by her maid, Lucia, was on her way to the Accoramboni villa, ostensibly to pay a daughterly call on her father, actually to coax money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting debts. Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress looked, and how cunningly the olive-green dress with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her perfect figure. Vittoria's thoughts were more complex.","Vittoria, accompanied by her Wed AA Courts ou hay wey to the Acco va nBouc wha, ostensibly fo Ex4 a daughterly caR cu her rather, actushly to coxx money Frou tht indulge arent 0 settle. her wont debés bucia woo thinking how Genudi ful her wi sdyers looked and how cunt ug hy the ove ~gv-e eu bre ss with cts undevsK iL 9d ypse- brocade fitlal her ; } pevtecd Figure Vittoria s were wore coun p+ex, "
k04-061.png,"The sparkling society of the Doria Palace, the flattery of Orsini's obsession, the thwarted ambitions of her restless spirit, all threw into sharp relief the contrast of her grey life with the splendid one that filled her dreams. At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien, and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco to give her a separate establishment, he invariably pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle, who had built the villa for his family.","The seacking society of} the Doria Fokace the datlevy OF Orsini’s ofsessiou,the thuartes! amGidiow of her restless sevvit fl threw lato sharp velietd the coulvxs of her grey fe with the sebeudid ane the filha h ev d creaws A€ the Vile Moutedho she feb ox, a Dien desl Atk hough She had vep-orted £5 urged Fron Cex, Co fo aive her ew secevate elu Glt shurer* she aye Cia Bly p Lesoled his Gnein Ca? depeudence ou fis uncke whe had Gu iat the yvhla for luis hetcns ts "
k04-064.png,"He reminded her that they must abide by Roman custom, and dwell there with their relations.

k04-068.png,"Her husband's gentleness and amiability, his unselfish love for her, she regarded as signs of weakness. He was a futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving her a child. Whatever passion she had experienced in the first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt. She had never loved him. Her thoughts rushed to Orsini. Since the meeting in the Doria Palace, no word had come from him, and this silence oppressed her spirits with a weight of misgiving.","Hev husband's gen tenes s and aniabi’/ty, his unselfish Cove for hey, she regarded as Signs of weakness, He was x Futi€e creature whe had not even proved capable of giving her a chi€d.

k04-075.png,"She had, perhaps, demanded too much. The kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus- pected depths in her, and she knew that if she yielded to him, her passion could, indeed, match his. Every instinct urged her to surrender, for there was that in his nature to which her own had responded as it had responded to no other human being.","She hoal, perhaps demanded too much, The kiss in She garden hool plumbed unsus- pected depths in her, and she knew tod iF she yie ed to him, her feeSSon coub/ indeed metch his. cuery jnstind urged hep Surrender For there uns Med in iS Nodu to which her OWN hod Fes pom deol «xs it oat responded to mo other humexy berg "
k04-079.png,"Prudence, ambition and reason had held instinct in check, and they must dictate her course. There could be no compromise. For a brief interval she allowed herself the luxury of dreams. She began to imagine life at Bracciano, the balls and fe*?5tes, the conversation of poets and dilettanti. She visualized the pageantry of the tournament, and herself on the ducal dais beside Orsini, placing a chaplet of roses on the brows of some young conqueror in the lists.","Prudence,cmbition omd reason bod eed instinct im check, «md they must dictode her course There coued he no Compromise.

k04-085.png,"This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop, nearly throwing the two girls from their seats. Lucia uttered a cry of alarm. 'Look, madonna, we are surrounded!' It was true. Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about them and a lean, swarthy fellow was peering through the window, grinning impudently. 'Santa Maria!' shrieked Lucia. 'Banditti!'","TS ververne wos vadek, ended as the cooch ao On S\CCENING felr ard come 46 aN abwuor St, Nearly shyewsine, the two ayx\s Crom shex CMS uae arrered o.

k04-093.png,"Vittoria now realized that they were outside Santa Maria degli Angeli, and that except for a few beggars crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting loathsome sores, the area was deserted. 'They are not banditti, Lucia,' said Vittoria, pointing to the badge on the man's shoulder. The words were clear. 'Beware my hug!' Lucia stared speechlessly at the golden bear; Vittoria swiftly averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance of the retainer.","Somer towia dai Arceli ond haa exceor Povo, Fea heoppu's Garching, 0 rhe deorwoe othe church ond estubiring, lothsome Sores, she rea was deserted.

k04-099.png,"Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic. The coach now turned in another direction, towards the wild and desolate region behind the baths. It was sparsely inhabited, dotted with fallow fields and terraced vineyards, and here and there jutted a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins, a pathetic reminder of Rome's former greatness.","Hey Ehoughts at this Moment were chaot{c.

k04-103.png,"In this region of Monti most of the public baths had been built in the time of the Caesars, but with the breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions the baths had lost their purpose; they had become stone quarries and their precious marble had been burnt for lime.

k04-106.png,"As they lumbered past at a rattling pace, Vittoria could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures gathered about it, cooking their frugal meal. These were left far behind. An old man be- labouring an overladen donkey, and a withered crone appeared on the horizon, were overtaken and forgotten.","As they lurnbered past at a rotting pace Wi tora could see a wisg af. smoze curling akwe the pre apa gy poy eucangimend wid a few Jotterdemabon creatures gathered wba?

k04-110.png,"Except for their escort, Vittoria and Lucia might have been the only living creatures on an empty planet. After the initial shock, Vittoria felt calm. She knew exactly what she wanted, and was prepared to take it without scruple, if she could. What she had forgotten in her self-absorption in her own schemes was that other people were equally absorbed in their schemes, which were likely to run counter to her own.","EXCtpt Yok Wet TSobyUlttoha cud Lice wighs hove Geen re oly Wing ive dhe on ana Cumply plane Aen Abe Minh tek Setld ii cet Falk Sole See Verw erloldy var She werted ont Way phe pirtl +o aeNe 1s wi ued Schple, UF she Goad ‘tees she bed Ve tpotien oe lepe S ElF - o GSotpttoan \~ kek oven Ghenes weg fet othe ptople We me cg wally a bscohbe) We thet schemes WM ete liiz/p to aa Leeks or bk eo Wes uo "
k04-115.png,"This move today was a reminder of that fact. Whilst she automatically patted the hand of the agitated Lucia, her brain was working rapidly, and she decided that she must be prepared to counter Orsini's demands, difficult though that would be. She became aware that the pace was slackening; now the coach stopped.","ee. Aodoy War a Fewiundoh S alors Sau, Whe?

k04-119.png,"The moment had come. Upon the ensuing interview the future would depend. Out- wardly she was calm, but her heart was beating fast, and the palms of her hands were damp. Orsini's high-crowned hat with its jaunty plume blotted out the light; his hand was on the door. Glancing at Lucia he said in French to Vittoria: 'Your maid ... is she reliable?'","The momess pad come. yon th ens ing my perview the pyture would depend.

k04-126.png,"She shrugged her shoulders, and replied in the same language: 'Yes. But make it worth her while.' 'I see. I know how to deal with people like that,' and turning to the cowering Lucia, he spoke in her own language. 'Do you know who I am?' 'No, signor,' she whispered. 'I am the Orsini. My word is law in Rome.'","Skz shaw i br shasblers, ond ry Lid in she Same Aon gt Ys. Rut mak i worth ber while, ' T sl.

k04-136.png,"Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat. Thrusting his head farther into the coach, he said sombrely: 'Have you ever heard of a punishment called the cord?' She blanched and shrank away. Was there not a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty, fifty, sixty feet into the air, and dropped again and again, until their arms were wrenched from their sockets. 'You have heard of it?","Lucia wos ane limos a rabbir Looks ot a Stoat Thess his hus! Forlur intr the Coach, le said Sombre ly: Howe you tuer heard of a puniskmunt lolli the Cord ?

k04-142.png,"The Orsini give that to traitors. There is no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini. We hunt a traitor down to the ends of the earth, and no power can save him ... or her. Do you understand?' 'Yes, signor,' she faltered. 'On the other hand,' he continued, giving her a keen look, 'the Orsini are generous to those who serve them faithfully.","ThE Ozsiwi give that te ftAlFes.

k04-149.png,"Remember that, my girl.' Lucia was beyond speech. He turned to Vittoria, sitting erect, with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with anger. 'And now, madonna,' he said smoothly, 'we will continue the conversation started at the Doria Palace. Be pleased to alight.' 'I think,' she replied coolly, 'I prefer to stay where I am.'","Remember tWat,my giel. Lucia was beyend Speech.

k04-156.png,"'In that case,' he reverted to French, 'I shall be obliged to lift you from the coach.' Without answering him, she rose, and bending over the agitated girl, said softly: 'No one will harm you, Lucia. Remain here.' Ignoring his proffered hand, she stepped from the vehicle. 'Will you be so good as to order your men not to molest my maid,' she said coldly to Orsini.","In thot case, he veverted to french, I shall be oblig. to Itt yoo fiom Hw coach.

k04-163.png,"'She is absolutely safe,' he replied; but he turned, nevertheless, to the man who had peered into the coach, whom he had addressed as Luigi, and gave him sharp instructions on the matter. Vittoria stood looking about her, breathing the scent of thyme. The land at her feet sloped away into a tiny valley beyond which, on the crest of a wooded hill-side, the ruins of a small temple were etched against the clear blue of the sky.","Sho is absolutely sate, ho vephied but he turnd4 ; nevertheless, 4o the man who has peeved mto Uw coach whom he had adbvesed. a5 lugs, ond opve lum Shevp inswehlions on vo matter.

k07-059a.png,"He forgot time and place. He, the master, was gently led along erotic paths which he knew existed, but had never trodden. He learned how to use his hands, how to adore that body without haste, how to caress every inch with his mouth as well, to creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost himself in a rapture of kisses in places he'd dreamed of, where life began to ooze and quickened his heart beat to a thunder.","He for got lime and place, te, Me masher, was gently Led along erohe paths which be khew existed, but haol never trodden.

k07-063a.png,"He looked at her. Head thrown back in a pool of hair, her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her heart in the full throat.

k07-067a.png,"He was having a ball! He twiddled the TV set with shaking hands. She sat calmly on the bed smoking a cigarette. His face was white with two red blotches. Hers was flushed and lovely.

l04-066.png,"Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate it beside the fire in the living- room, his thoughts once more on Kitty. If she was really in love with Stevie Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her, he told himself moodily. Yet it was not as clear-cut as that.

l04-071.png,"Tonight, for the first time, he had abandoned all pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling for her. She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected him. In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged a bond between them. No doubt she had every intention of keeping both of them on a string. On the whole he probably had a slight advantage over the young man, inasmuch as he had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy respect for the material things of life.","Tougls, For tHe First time, be lad abandoned all pretence aud shown lor tle Lenet deperation of lis Feeling for lar, She Lad neither encouraged wor completely rejected lim In some perverse way thelr brief quarrel lad forged a boud between them.

l04-087.png,Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided? Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong panel and pulled it out.

l04-093.png,"He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor to count them. Of course, he remembered being in a great hurry to get that fifty pounds for Kitty! Obviously he had been careless in replacing the panel, but the possibility of anyone having discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock. As he replaced the bundles of notes, he withdrew the tin box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the cupboard.","Ne Weed out the heavy bundles of aches ond Vnelt on the Flos ho Court Hhem.

l04-106.png,"In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh Mansell and Roddy Dowell drank their beer and waited. 'It's too damn busy in here.

l04-113.png,"'O.K., Roddy, whatever you say.' Hugh drained his glass and ordered two more beers. 'I'm really beginning to feel it's all a bit of a waste of time, anyway.

l04-130.png,"'Miles off his proper route to Dover or the airport at Lydd', Roddy interposed quickly. 'And once there he was shot at close range and his money smartly filched. You know, whoever it was might have known of the existence of the suicide letter... providing him with an almost unshakable alibi.' Hugh was thinking of his uncle, but said nothing. After all, Julian had acted very strangely since the tragedy, always secretive, always reluctant to discuss his brother's death.","Miles off is pagper rove 6 Dever om the cxirper af kydd, Roddy wiepaed guickly, Und once there fe weed shat at clase range wud fos money smarty pled Jer bnawy, whoteer 7 wo neg nt have brow of she exicknce of fhe suicide Letter 0. providing bine witle au alco unshaluble wid; Hay t wg feirting yf bis weele, bot sed wong. oper ath jen bac achd yey shangely snce phe hag Ay, always secrepee, aluags rachis fo dius bts brother's deeds "
l04-136.png,"It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a cold-blooded murder but, in fact, Henry Mansell's death had saved the firm and Julian's future. Moreover he might well have been aware of his brother's intention to skip out of the country and passed on the information. 'I'm sure you're right', Hugh said thoughtfully. 'But whoever did it got clean away without being spotted.'","H wes mpossible fo assogete lure one's mind with a WA blooild nurder bul,n fect, Henry Mansel © deat tad saved Me puna ced Futerst's Jeter Morewer fe peight utd have bec aeure of Hes Arother's petenttn to shy ait yf the corinfoy deh jpascd om the ef avietien Im sure gere right, Fgh sad thcrig tet fully ft wherever hid 4 gor Met Cele’ “plot? deg fooTkea "
l04-141.png,"'Easy enough along that stretch of coast road in winter, believe me', Roddy affirmed solemnly. 'He probably caught the next boat across the channel and has been lying low with the money somewhere.' Hugh nodded. 'I realized that after my talk with Mrs. Lawford. There are a dozen countries where a man could easily hide up and change the money without danger.","Easy enough along Hot shetch oP wast road in winter, believe me’, Roddy afGrme) sobmly.’He probably cought the ned boat across the channel owd hav been Aging low with the money somewhere.’ Hugh nodded.’ I realibed +hoat aFter my 4odk with Ars.

'I've put everything I know before them....'","Unless we can get a definite tne on him its hopeless ae spanething will turn up one lay , youll see) Roddy said contdently.

l04-153.png,"'No dice, Hugh.' Roddy shook his sandy head. 'They're bound to want pretty solid new evidence before they'll agree to reopen the case. From their point of view the evidence for suicide is overwhelming.

l04-159.png,"But as he quite reasonably pointed out the money could have been disposed of in London before your father left that evening. It wouldn't be unnatural for a man in his position to make provision for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded as particular debts of honour before taking his own life. Also, logically, there's nothing to show the money couldn't have been pinched by someone passing the car after your father was dead.","i ie quite reasouc bly pointed out the money could lave been disposed of m Londor bere your father LePl that eenieg.

l04-163.png,"Stealing from cars is about the commonest kind of crime in the book. There's nothing that absolutely ties the missing money to the circumstances of your father's death, that's the point.

To the right of the lawn, close to the water's edge, stood an ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria; it was built across a narrow backwater and there was a delicate iron staircase climbing the outer wall to a room above.","Fran Ws eo, Awermsack wos dose forerddung: Ib Broad a dang Wok vock Yom the Wodst ak ths and of a yalvaly Yoton QQoneach with Mowanng {22S and ahrubs.

m01-000.png,"A shudder, more mental than physical, ran through him, and his mind seemed to melt away into emptiness. His bulging eyes caught the reclining form of Heather, who was still repeating in sing-song: "". . . I will not give in. . ."" He stared at her blankly, mouthing an incoherent gabble of half words.","A vhuabler, more mental than physical , tan thiough him, and AW mind seemed to met away into emphinew. tly bulging Lya caught the redining form of Heates Who was till Kpeating in sing-Jong: ""balk not give in...

m01-012.png,"He slapped himself in the face and cuffed the sides of his head. Then by degrees the rotating objects slowed, and coming into focus took the form of the furnishings in Dan Brown's living room. He stood up unsteadily and looked about the room, trying to gather his wits. Outside the dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and the heights beyond were in silhouette, already a solid black.","Ne ha pped bum self jn Ye fave and. oufe ol too sidos of hit htad. then by olagrecs tho rotating otzect towed , anol corning nto Focus toot Ho form of Ve prnishingn ln Daw Brown's Living yoo.

m01-017.png,"He bumped into a floor lamp and switched it on. Heather McNabb still lay on the couch, her body uncomfortably twisted and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks. He went to the kitchen for water and found Dan. Dan was lying on a long bench in the breakfast nook, his head bent upright against the wall.","& buryel ine a Hoor law) antl Ssuthel fon. beater Ke Lab #t loy on he couch, her body incom forlably tusec! and afflicted ut, oe Puaspodic jerks. bb wool Me bilebeo for water ancl found Din.

m01-022.png,"His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat, as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks brought forward. He mouthed a low mutter, punctuated at intervals with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon. As Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut, with jaws askew.","Ws Usually aumated face was eaxpesiouless aud looted Cel, as Wouyh Wis uose lad eo (bushed back aud Vis ayes aud checks broujht forward.

m01-026.png,"There was utter imbecility in his blank face. Presently the muttering started again, and went on and on. Stunned and shaken, Steve drew a glass of water and went back to Heather. Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects. For several minutes they had been facing each other across a low table, like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with each other through forced association.","Thue was ull jumbscilsby iin bus blode fave. fresuiy the water clad aguin, aud went om aud on.

m01-032.png,"Then something like a zest for living began to come back to Steve and he squeezed her hand. Her face took on enough animation to produce a wan smile. Dan's low muttering was just audible from the kitchen. And Steve could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions she was growing cold and numb with shock. She had seen Dan, or rather the physical relic of him - the empty shell of flesh and bone, devoid of intellect and personality.","Then tonbtiny (ike a geit for Living began to come batk to Jove an he wyueezed fic flared, Wer fait heb on Chugh animation 0 prbllace a wan smile .

The Base Station had gone before, discharging its narrow plane of 4ementalating energy along the length of the Earth's imaginary longitudes, moving eastward like a knife-edged twilight in reversed progression. It had brought the First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest, the empty-minded receptiveness that prepared the way for the Second Stage.","Ard Ke bak ber, by feral quekike Millan be tar.

m01-049.png,"He rose from his breakfast-nook bench and came into the livingroom, where Heather and Steve stood aghast at his entrance. He came, almost falling forward in an ungainly shuffle, neck thrust out, arms dangling loosely. Then, abruptly, he drew himself up and walked on the very tips of his toes. He stretched his arms over his head and yawned agape, drawing-in great breaths that became great sighs of ecstacy.","H2 JOW FiOw LY Wi@WAC{Cy}-Nook€ Wack OW. cQre wilo Me Lin pico, Lo Pare HectfeF Onel Neue yleco! agfay) al Ms ahauce.

m01-079.png,"A superfluous precaution for there was no other car abroad; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait at an intersection for the light to change. At his apartment he garaged his car and then stood listening in the night. Listening in vain.

m01-084.png,"Deadly stillness, deadly portent! Steve awakened early and switched on the radio, which he kept tuned to CBO. The set lighted-up but gave only a low buzzing sound.

m01-090.png,"After what seemed an undue period of repetition, the voice went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony in Sussex, in all its obscene details. Then the radio went dead again, and Steve had no stomach for breakfast. It was a beautiful day, as firsts-of-June should be. Steve got out the car and traversed the same empty streets as he had the night before, to keep an appointment with Heather.","jr Wi tead Leeutd ia Ande Pencd f reper , Me “Ite wtat cu fe Hutnbe He Aeredecs of Hu Meshes cclewy MM Duster, au alt the glvaue Ahaclt.

m01-095.png,"Coming around the great mass of the Chateau Laurier, he braked to a screeching stop. A flying saucer was tilting and dipping over the War Memorial. There was a deep whirring sound, and a high-pitched hissing overtone that sang in his ears with an almost painful sharpness. He reversed and turned back on McKenzie Avenue.","Comma aaoumel the great wor of the Chatoon horuwr 2 Laket to a qereechiug olop.

m01-100.png,"The Thetans must not see him! He took another route to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on the way. Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at once; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss their situation, as far as it could be assessed, and to decide on what seemed to be the best way of meeting it.","The Tlutaus must wot see lim! te took auc Route 10 tatlus's cmd say two wot flyiug SQUCOS (CU Huw Nay Wotlee Was Very oursicus ho ust Dan of Oud; bit Re iusiskd that Huy shoul pie olisouss Hui( Mahou , as fos as it coud be assesseal, cud + oledde ou What sewed to be lio Lest Way of With Ug it.

m01-104.png,"""The Thetans,"" he said, ""are presumably here to take charge, as it were, of the minds of the people - who are probably falling all over themselves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry them out.

m01-110.png,"There can be little doubt that if the Thetans discover our mental independence they will promptly give us their hypnotic treatment. If we can avoid undue prominence, it may be that we can move about pretty freely without detection. If we can - well, then we may be able to promote our own interests. What those interests are, beyond personal security, I haven't a clue; but, who knows, we may form the nucleus around which some sort of resistance movement may be built.","a i ond be Li'l. olouwkd that v he Vilas OL, seo Om~ Oc bree teva, Ory te ) ole Or ole—ce Avy LU frrobe bl, P haa Zc $ Ae, ag prehec ok U/ wee C45 mow sal bitin, pillens.

m01-121.png,"There is just a hope that we may uncover some weakness, and find a way of fighting back at them."" Heather agreed, and suggested that they use Dan as a specimen demonstrating how the Thetan machinations had been working out.

m01-125.png,"So they proceeded to see if the coast was clear. The street was quiet and deserted, and there were neither sight nor sound of flying saucers. So they ventured forth and made their way on foot to Dan's house. Dan came to the door at their ring but neglected to offer any greeting. He was deeply preoccupied, and it seemed that the ringing of a doorbell was to him a new and strange phenomenon.","DO They preceeded to cea Pt tle coact was Clas.

m01-131.png,"When he finally beckoned to them to enter, the action gave the impression of having been thought out and decided upon. Inside they sat down unbidden, while Dan paced the floor. He seemed completely unaware of their presence. They just stared at him, turning their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and down, up and down.","When he roll, Lecioned to dtr, to enler, the archon que Hae inp r655# A op hanng been thought out and cleciclod upon .

m01-136.png,"His whole attitude was a mixture of impatience pending an awaited communication and of a vague perplexity respecting his surroundings and the purpose he was to serve. Finally, being so obviously on their own, Heather and Steve tried to make themselves at home. Steve switched on Dan's powerful, world-wide radio and sys- tematically turned the tuning knob through all the tuning points of the world's great radio stations.","His udbole attitcole was a mixtore of Ww puhence percling an awarlect Common cation avol O4 oO vagve Prey igegrey Wis Soros awl We prspose. he wns to sere.

m01-149.png,"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue, where he waited. The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street. But not for long, for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon the Avenue from its many tributary streets. It might have been a normal business-day bustle, except for two anomalies. First, it was Sunday morning; and, second, everyone walked, or drove, or waited as a person possessed of a single all-exclusive purpose.","We wailed.

m01-160.png,"After a long wait a bus appeared and they followed the beaming Dan aboard, taking seats some rows behind him. Steve was beginning to find the stereotyped, flattish, happy faces very disconcerting; and looking at Heather he found a welcome relief in her relatively long doleful one.","lifer a Lory meth a bus eppentd capd Mey folloned Me Leung Dun bore , Ankhirg seit Ack ron) Aebeid him. tee Was Leyinning Ae ford Ae shertchyged, fedeh, Aeppy fue very oleuoneoliy , cand Lechury at Pleat pe furd e weleme gelled wh Kt "

And Heaven alone knew when, if ever, he would be back on Moon again, and able to do research at first hand into matters on which the future of everyone, including Angelina, depended...","Yhen be would go hack fo [tabs po 3 fue gel of eal chys oud would refurr fo Mew Jook i [ale Jousony 0+ eonly thywery. hgelira wuiglt he a LHe souy Powe were tet back fr Cheiit nas 45 aihocag cf, hut he @useted laiasef hy tha kivig Miah fe aud Aag chive eentelih daee flety of Fime fogether jiu the fabave Kad Kewmue aac Kaew walen , Pever, he would be Cook 04 bon aga, ard ak fe db fesececls af ped lived ako wnalles ote tefl he fubive of ever youe, ji cluding Hegclirer, depeude..

m02-052.png,"The recovery of his balance was due to the fact that he was living, virtually without expenses, with the people to whom Moke had sent him: little people who regarded him as lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes.

m02-066.png,"All Aristotle was excited at the time, not by the prospect of the U.S. President's visit, but by a great storm in the photosphere of the sun.

m02-069.png,"One wondered if this greater awareness of the physical cosmos might with time instil the reverence which, on Earth, nature inspires, especially when one reflected that the rockets over which Mr. Peron's Board presided had it in their power permanently to warp the solar system. True enough, such ultimate weapons had not been used in the last few wars, but it seemed very probable that they would be in the next one, Moon and her allies being more inferior than formerly to W.C.U. in the weapons pronounced conventional.","be derelre ff Chi feck awsenes of the guia! cana reff he fot ppb te pyrene Wik, on Ealh, phot mngoia, ayecils whey one fle fed [hol be puch oper cthih Ne fori a jouer roa A wip We der pun fue whips, Yuth wmgle weapons fad pol bet ded! ; bbe Co Mle fe wet, bab | veep, luyy yprobde Mal Chey ould Le 19 fle NO xf xe, flo» end) Pit aed being tre wnforiy than fare 2 Ul Cb rm» bbe Weagypon pronowrced cevter ters!

m02-083.png,"Peron entered, a large man, who had once been handsome but was now seedy-looking, a sufferer from stomach-ulcers. In the Back-Face tradition he wore, and kept on indoors, a fifty gallon hat. Harry was prepared for something unpleasant, for this was the Senator who had annoyed the United States by bragging how he had once won a trick from W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his rockets (an admission which would scarcely help bluff to succeed the next time) and, lately, by saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region, ""no Mo dough-boy will want to have an American G.I. fighting alongside him.""","Féron entered, 2 loge man tte fad once Lee hands one bet wes Now S22H - (esting )@ scfkver fram storach-uleers. /n Ma Gack-fKacn faLthicn te Gore, ar keton e/6ors, 2 Pty gallon hat. hr tv boas Prepared Cer cemathing myphesest, Gr Ws nes tha Serater whe hac @oncy a 4a Cin teH States by bregging Aa 4a hal ance. twara freak ban INE.0. by Lrreatennn te loose. off ora of As fechale for wate csi abe Ch col scorcely Zale lof fs soccxxY %Q nexhk tipaa.

Yet when the time came to leave, Harry felt as depressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office, exactly a month ago. If even Mo statesmen only did what they had to do to get GO on an expanding scale, and left the sum-total of their actions, and their lunar and earthly repercussions, to luck (or to Moke), there was a vacuum where there should be a centre of trust, responsible for the maintenance and expansion of free society.","ee et el gue Hos bee of isin wad, bis Lar a Hoe Hoa rocked mom's cham uaa disameng.

m02-106.png,"But since starting salaries would depend on grade A or B in the finals next May, and since mating prospects would depend upon salaries, scholarship for these fine young people was closely geared to economic and biological ends which, essentially, were really means. So, seeing them revolve in circles, Harry had the feeling that Moke (or what Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised, anyway in Harry's mind) had these splendid young people by the short hairs, and was diverting them from true life.","Bat since slots suloctas woudl glepml on geache of ee Bin He foal nek May aud since. mag prospects world fepend Upor calacle , scbiolavsl, 2, these Lone young peaple was olerely gea-ee bo CCOneim anel bidlegical enol which ,essentlly were ae meacs.

m02-112.png,"So once again the metaphysics were depressing, and in absolute contrast to the phys- ical display.

He peered as it were into the dark secrets of the jungle. 'Think there's Indians about?' It was most certainly an eerie night, exceptionally brilliant and strange, for in the proximity of the mountains, whose presence I could almost smell, the air grew less humid and as there was no moon the galaxies had it their own way so that the forest looked ever more mysterious in their faint, silver light.","yrometling'S UP 4 “suck Cr Unelortone, crefrlly casu2t, , The serv2uts ae Con edge...

I allowed myself to entertain for an instant the idea, the strange, the unwelcome, the almost inconceivable idea, that Ariadne's arrival would be inopportune; and with the idea came a somewhat vulgar impulse, which I refused, to watch Mr Septimus more closely, Mrs Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would surely show some anxiety by now if he noticed anything untoward.","Scllly onc ol course (lus Aphmus fer witty fr Sephaws shod n Ke sae care ad oysell 7 Gab woo & sa?

Indeed we were all invaded by a most tranquil mood. Even the Indian servants relaxed, knowing, so Mr Gilberto told us, that the wild and savage tribes never approached this region: at any rate they remained with us, perhaps for such protection as our presence, or Mrs Caine's, afforded, sticking rather to their quarters, going no further than the beach to fish, whereas we ourselves explored the whole neighbourhood, half, I think with an eye to fabulous remains.",Buk all Reeo wee 40 Lo casual beeriatan 1 paribed ony sel) unrffled j (ly Sxphimus reseed ook costouiny very Kougtafah but Rod was luis Lobi Indoad oe were A invaded by a most ranqui( mod.

m04-007.png,"And a fine old fuss there was about it, too. Here are the known facts. On 10th July, the bus, the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl, left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual. Aboard, apart from the crew, were Mrs. Megan Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader; pretty little Morfydd Owen; Mr. Stanley Hayball and Miss Ethel Yates, hikers from Birmingham; Price the Provisions; and the Rev.

m04-012.png,"Yes, the bus set out from Dinas. So much is established. Ifor Huw Evans, Propr., watched it go from the windows of the Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested, Ifor was. For there was his garage hand, Dai Pugh, taking a tearful farewell of Morfydd Owen. Morfydd, who had until recently been Ifor's typist, but was now returning to her home town as a fully-fledged schoolteacher.","Be he ced oct fem Whees, Fo meh is ectablishd, Mov Huw Evans, Propr., watchid if go from TA wirolons of Hy Dinas Mot Onnthys Co, Vary tadrashol, Ifov was.

m04-024.png,"""Silly boy,"" said Morfydd. Though she could not help wondering whether, now she had qualified as a schoolteacher, poor little Dai was quite the man for her. A nice boy of course. But perhaps in the new world she was entering there might be boys equally nice, and with far more to offer. The conductor rang his bell.","“Shy bey, sard Mofydd.

m04-030.png,"""Good-bye, Dai,"" said Morfydd, smiling from the bottom step. ""Good-bye, Morfydd."" He sought to enfold her in his arms. But he was too late. She was already up the bus steps, and the bus was away. And Morfydd Owen waving, unkissed, from the window. And Dai, on the pavement, knowing in his heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas.","SAME MDA te anf he a S80 3 aro, OS eer bs, Hs sen Day Ba Tes ago, ode Son aera, Wd ah Sse nace eA en Ba abi, Stl en pat haan on nA MD beat lp water "
m04-038.png,"So the bus set out for Llangrwl. But it never reached there! Somewhere, on those fifteen miles of mountain roads, it disappeared from the earthly scene. The first intimation that all was not well came when a Mr. Isaiah Roberts, landlord of The Traveller's Joy, rang up the Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their damn bus.","rors, Abe Wr clams Bat MM at md al soos hen "" M4.

m04-072.png,"The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to complete her mission."" Paled, did Dai. For the two-twenty carried, for him, a cargo more precious than jewels. Though Mofydd Owen was, as he feared, departed out of his life, he still loved her dearly. Already, even as with trembling fingers he fastened his trouser clips, he was seeing her lying in some dreadful ravine, or beset by robbers, or being whisked off to Emergency Ward 10.","The tio-tisndty to lana bes fell Yo Complete tie wigion.""

m04-113.png,"Dai, meanwhile, was pedalling furiously on the road. Not a sign of the bus. He passed The Traveller's Joy. At last he caught up Mr. Roberts, walking very dogged towards Llangrwl. ""Afternoon, Mr. Roberts,"" he called, polite, as he shot past. His spirits were rising. He had seen no sign of an accident. Therefore Mr. Roberts must have been mistaken. He would find the bus safe and sound in Llangrwl, and his dear Morfydd quietly having tea in her own home.","Da!) mtannutil , nas potalling purtourky or tha rood, Met a rign of the Aus, Re par Ae harveller *n Jey.

The Captive with the fleshless jaw said, 'The grub of the tigerfly thinks it dies when it changes into a tigerfly.' 'You are still young,' said the Chief Captive. 'You begin newly here. Where are your souls?' Lily-yo and Flor looked at each other.

m06-067.png,"'You are too foul to live!' Haris growled. 'Why are you not killed?' 'Because we know all things,' the Chief Captive said.

m06-106.png,"Motion there was, but motion without event - except for those negligible events that seemed so large to the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated with their wings soon died away as the wonderful new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World had no place here.","Makion Hrere wos, lout rchon usthouk event - except Por Hease neaigide event tok Seered go large to We cteotures porbicipatiag ta When.

n01-000.png,"Alastair was a bachelor. All his life he had been inclined to regard women as something which must necessarily be subordinated to his career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl whom he had never met and on whom after no more than a couple of telephone calls he was prepared to place complete reliance.","Moshay Hoo @ bachelor fu bas fe bee pot Aun wielirud x ‘gid HIME?

n01-004.png,It was a novel experience. Alastair was quite unable to explain why he should feel so much confidence in her. Once again she checked back her instructions.

n01-020.png,"For some reason the orderlies had forgotten to switch on the lights; there was no colour - physical features were distinguishable solely by gradations of silvery greyness. Even the snow-capped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles below, was not recognisable among the host of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air radar glowed. Occasionally minute spots flickered across its surface, but there was no permanent image.","te ent or He Aalf, Mere ee re cobper - capped oummaf of Atrd Ware, reyer mbee helen, wie 04 seceqrioble aming Me bef of lower peahe He vereern of fe ar-tt dir flecked werme the onface, bt bre ate "
n01-031.png,"In the exceptional clarity he was even able to make a direct comparison between the radar image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the left, Milan. The directional angle of the scanner could be adjusted to cover any particular area within its range. Geoffrey turned the scale slowly to cover the ground immediately ahead.","hh the exceptional darity he was even able to make a direct Comparison between the radar Image and He gromd itself, Mead Lay the Plain of Lombardy j to the right , Turin; to the heft Milan.

n01-036.png,"He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle was resting could really mean hundreds of knots.","le wast able fo pick aud own, uirecogitia be fo We Naked fe, Obttire? by the frome hate which ever Cp te cleattsf night Linveo ae L1sIOn. fe foe al te sped wearer. seemed alo mncreable pha Ue tay Loh ke Jper f es apiintf which the peer jal ates cou? way VELL pumown of LION.

n01-045.png,"Now, as Alastair reduced the thrust, the pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft dipped slightly. The needle of the speed recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0 before coming to rest at 5.0. ""We're a bit ahead of time,"" said Alastair. ""We'll run in on minimum engine power."" Geoffrey smiled. Alastair talked of running in when they were still more than four hundred miles from their destination.","Warr, 12 actin reduced the frre, Me Jip ily.

n01-052.png,"They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port. He was able to trace the course of the river; he thought he could recognise the route of N12, along which he had motored so desperately little more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then he had flown to England, attended the vital conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked by special helicopter from the Horse Guards Parade to Boscombe Down, slept for six blessed refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds of the journey back to the place where every indication pointed to Eve being held.","Thay, wer roars, Hodana, Tpofftry freumedl Hee radar scoms outs leoridge over Re Poy oct, fp forty rege | oa a sa 40 Jongarele, AX ~ = C ce Un Bruce + ce Gaon kael ‘A Polis ko Horse uarda ml fo Bec Don, aq fore ld ededkina Bours aul aol now compre! tans "
n01-057.png,Geoffrey set himself to consider the movements of the Bentley. It had passed him at the temporary bridge over the Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the previous night. He worked out the distance on the presumption that its route had been through Florence and Rome and then across Italy via Foggia to Barletta. It came to just over six hundred miles.,- ad tbe _ Ans wes fl. fatter od a fos whe pith pint He fetes typed fh biked ted fle Alf te On Mr preg uitapheb Med db wh hak deinen Mi. he et phat Ms /opyed A nil be W Cane © Gel OS ak ad bia ap

And though Guy, made nervous by Beryl's silence, drove at reckless speed to the Villa, it was quickly evident that the party was over.

n02-004.png,"To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a vengeance. She had expected to be met with violent reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling. But it did not take her long to realise that his mood was less pleasant than appeared on the surface.

n02-016.png,"""Oh, she was due!"" And then he added in the same casual tone, ""She's not returning to her family. She's going to live with friends of the bank manager, just this side of Belleray."" Mrs. Deane made a suitable comment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying to sort things out in her mind.

n02-028.png,"Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise, and to express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment of his guests. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl sug- gested having a second party, the following week, he poured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared, had had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them nearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-earned gratuity to his native village at the north of the island.","me wud a. wre quid igo aul Quit 1. : { 4 - (Ls, aod call i \is al Kat Ciags tnaved ad dl buy tga basing <ciea ak Ms ae esi side pots old wh ode pagal Dru, ' dulacth ae hud e Le. oh wy wd { e a it wast \ wud stal t oh ae Min - Wesel i Wed mld base bebelin bed ad Loa ual sk ly 1M ine ge wt he iva "
n02-033.png,"It was all over and done with. For the time being Beryl was content to let it go at that, but she resolved to have it out with Piers when a reasonable opportunity presented itself.

Continuing on, his leaping mind flashed pictures of chicanery and corruption, the growth of the deadly decadence and absorption in debasement and Satanic debauchery.","Ky.

p02-076.png,"Gay thanked him and walked out on to the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin had bought a drink and taken it outside. She looked round scanning the tables, then caught her breath, a cold hand seeming to clutch her heart. Gavin was seated at a small table in a shadowy corner talking animatedly to Simone. As Gay watched he offered the girl a cigarette and lit it, his hands cupping hers in an intimate way.","Gon Roukeet bur ud oer Or ar lo RA erooe HUkeug Kat pelos Gown Led Loug\aq dhiuk aud lobe i achidk.

Larry's advice flashed through her mind, but she turned away, giving a little gesture of hopelessness, knowing that her pride would never allow her to look the other way and aware too, that her love for Gavin had already lessened, although she was suffering the pangs of jealousy.","Coy ALOOSA APHOLK Lor a PaQuarat LAcf BLCIALS LO GO LAK Oud jore Urtqou aud YOO PRK ahr Darelect I> do no prior Kore PO paiyatorda to Lar soon beemosrding Kort Gowns OHM Lomg Le Lad tera Pu iLook Lk Aoprck Lax, ras Grade, LUMA prikLa gut Kk RA Rod Orta pred an Yrs prrprredag belo, LOwtys adisice Lawkwr Wvaugh RBs prac berk AL Ar berurrund CHDK | GQWOAMG, oa Lldee Yar Of FAH RAASAM prtctog. fer OMA Mad LA "

""That is a pretty dress,"" Lilyan commented, obviously sensing Gay's distress and in a way that Doc, as a man, could not understand, knowing that Gay was as much ashamed for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she was hurt for herself.","Because she wes secon best The other came back Te Tho table ,all oF them makie a fear of her and al ovce She Feit haps . bay Loued them for thers Warn.

p06-052.png,"'Good-bye, Sandra,' he said with a deadly finality. Watching him go, unable to speak, she felt that part of her was leaving with him. She couldn't hate him...

p06-058.png,"She went back to Philip. But all she could hear were Nicholas's words: 'I love you - oh, you know that well enough.' Love. She revolted against the word.

p06-069.png,"She had her truth. How much had built up from that first ideal, and how little joy, or satisfaction, it had given her. 'I'm sorry, darling.' He looked nervous.

'It will be interesting to see what comes out at the inquest.","WX eye, olahined i. tetmek fre aece Hak rhe wes Hl p Ae bral?’ ‘Good heaves, Aaj, pty ou eat aha fh ake 4.* Bevrale, A ras. 1p] se id [Lieve Wwe, Lerayl end ce , lie trate, Livny one neylt wat be A, beer Mifach, Eletonr bouelod Lite tofhs He cold bur a Pepe se.

p06-096.png,"What his story will be. I reckon he'll confine himself to the nervous origin of her recent illness. His notes will be truthful, but what he leaves out will matter most.'

p06-242.png,"Philip bristled. 'It was never our intention to have one of those carnival affairs,' he retorted and in that second, he became the man of success exerting authority.

r02-000.png,"He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those self-employed. By the time his monthly salary arrived, the Inland Revenue had already taken their share, and there were precious few reductions in tax save for wives, children, life-insurances or any of the other normal encumbrances which Cecil had so far avoided.","He Vad loug seuseol iv {justice iu the dlistiuctious dlvawu loedweeu ovolivary wage - earurers aud tose Sdlf-ewployed, By the die Us woutlly salavy avviveol, the lulowdl Revere baal alveoaly Tala their Showe, owiel freve weve precass few Yeluctious iA Tx Save ¢ov wives, culovan, life-inswwauces ov auy of the adler vorwuall Aicwubvouces ybliicu Cecil tadl so fav ovoiokgof, "
r02-003.png,"He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases, but also postponed demanding the tax until her financial year was ended, audited and agreed by the Inspector.

r02-006.png,"At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake had claimed tax relief on the purchase of sev- eral mink coats which, it seemed, were necessary to further her career. Alternatively, it was reported, she tearfully claimed that the warm coats were heating appliances and therefore susceptible to a depreciation tax allowance as plant and machinery. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue wisely refrained from asking how she paid for the mink coats but demanded a receipt instead.","AY Ore prod fhe attatke fie Chucpecate LOG eautucol Kae rei Ou Kul frwt . “Lape of fereat leuk Coed plo, jf paced, trae ee, fo fees - Her Lees CALE | Ala atorely, a wer lepeot ed, lhe #eas jee C/aitaed haf Aes ZY Zht2, Coatlt ree Aeattd Afyp ee ex Ce 0 Aa of Vhewe fore Jt cpp bk FO G Aepreaahtr, 72x ehlow An e Dl Vidal Jtn AS Cte Aen Cats GF. ae "
r02-010.png,"Between all the interested parties, the final agreement had been delayed long enough for Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which by rights should have been re- served for her tax. Discounting one chinchilla jacket, a Rolls-Royce and a Sussex manor house, all three of which were in her husband's name, she now declared herself bankrupt."," Letter ail Me prbechel nc tes, Xe oa Ggnenect bad Cer dilegat tog enrgee£ Le Mss CRC acl.

r02-013.png,"The train drew into another station and Cecil, with a further six stops to go, was left almost alone in the coach. He fumed as he recollected the long correspondence he had had with the Inland Revenue in an effort to obtain tax relief for a jacket used solely in the office. 'If the jacket is a condition of your employment,' the Inspector had written, 'it may qualify for relief.'","She VW AVG0-— L110 AWAY GRAPH tit heal, Ah a felled for GAL O50, tet Lh Abid? tlme ter flee Chic, fl fveeserex” bf fle [ete tei le leg tegen Me WA lad tix Me ~Ar thar Ce- fitct. lto hte Me ce (94 fetta El A JAE LUE” hy eo “te tice.

r02-038.png,"'It's not mine. I wasn't sitting there.' She blinked disdainfully at him and stepped out. It was a new briefcase, and as the train jogged along the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil. He wondered what it contained. Probably the remains of someone's lunch or a few secret files. He smiled at his own joke.","hs acek acess heat svt ung thine” Sle Uwked dodonafutly at hu oud upped owt.

r02-060.png,"Cecil searched in his pockets once more and came up with two paper-clips. After a few seconds of twisting, he roughly thrust a bent wire loop into the lock and waggled it around vigorously. There was a click and the briefcase opened. Cecil thrust an eager hand inside, his fingers groping after wads of five pound notes.","Leal gearclec! in Gis pockuksS once mor and Game up will too Paper -Clics. era eo xcorels Oo HIS , Co roveLily {Cowl o bem tare Loop Into Cu Lock anol RADgeA Wel 1 CrGuNcl MAonousCy. “Row has aACLick arc!

'Old fashioned fivers!' he muttered again, and tried to recall if they were still legal tender. Surely the Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never break their promise to pay on rude demand, let alone on polite request.","by dose! on a sige June 70, lnc Wb WIS any fp, fe Vil WA to fit Vai “led On a pls f nf Why PO"" fn LY cn Oe we 0b fishin’ few, ? he nite gem, ed tied b yc /f thy pre dtl hy!

r02-078.png,"He climbed the stairs, eager to unload the guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and t hen to emerge carrying his shame unseen, but burning, into the night. He reached the barrier and fumbled for his contract before thrusting the briefcase at the ticket- collector with the firm intention of playing the dutiful citizen retrieving lost property.","Pe Chiubed fhe phitt , Cage. 10 trload rhe fak-syen bo/ tyrin Hbe pitheh -coflec tov oui Pbts 4 Cant rye aarry (ay bij ~biing wntes / buf Girr tty Yate the high. he veiched be Gari, aadf fem bed fer bis ten rert be fore Hbcuitty Abe briefeae a4 the prihel- colecty with fhe form Jo ft ron off playin the Metofal ters Ye Pier ti Avk popey .

'You're later than usual, aren't you?' His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange for the labels from half a hundredweight of Trunk and Greppes Tannin-free Tea.","Kill. itl Mid 0 bay thay € bi (opba tart wilt Lhe bile oy He grered thee fren! ter de raft titel aol, tetryg bi Lack tor ha, cortivad 10 sth, the bid tcc tole bthitlig bifutie phe Uo poured ag lead Gd te ptt td thaw feudtle - putin’ thie -yae ii ptt pypectiitle ta wal cuybcatd td tm bile Vere, on le filer than ipucl , wea? you? hi prather Ceiba fer ypeey pei te te pall ruiver Tey fad trce lini! dt a fee pil w ccc ange for be tb forn fof a Penile wa ghl tik ual Oyper fltartr~ free Jl "

His digressions too, seemed to have no other purpose than the throwing of dust in his client's eyes, the dust of fake security, of the fake friend of the family, like the puffs from his Gauloises, which said 'Don't you worry your fluffy little head about that, just lull back in the layers of my experience,' as he told her how he had saved one of his clients from buying a house in which he somehow owned all the bricks and mortar but not the joists, which had been omitted from the Deeds, and how he had learnt from another client who was a greengrocer that all greengrocers cheat the income-tax by a complicated system of unrecorded purchases which has become the norm at Covent Garden.","ee ee ee Pe ee eS a ee ee a ee unrecorded eutchonen which hes booms the norm at Covent Cunden.

One side of this square is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar. For one day, with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative, we had been hunting for furnished rooms, and had given up, when an elderly lady, the owner of a residence called the Poet's Nest, had firmly closed the door in our noses.","One caled fu Patio 3 Communth cel ah Ke dome of gw Srval Uh wa, Hmiry hee ove “pe vba Fmahsts ah Grtrek ole Gaul .

r06-011.png,"We went in. There were a few people in the bar, elderly, well-off, artistic, who, you felt, had made a hard bargain for giving up. 'I have furnished rooms,' said Pierre, 'and all mod cons.' The price was 16,000 francs a month. 'Yes,' we said immediately, even before viewing. We were shown around by Pierre.","We vat a.

We had a morning at Pierre's. He talked about people. Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named Lawrence. He was here, near the railway station, three or four years. During this period he wrote a book, The Lover of Lady Chatterly.","The tay wee, a beet, below wo, cy of en, Ver of Prem nieve Laflesd om Me windine SM, Wo Omid or a reahy mmf top, He ote par Cepulahiy .

r06-041.png,"There was a front-page rear-attack on de Gaulle, and the rest of the paper was given up to murders, apart for an outcry against a proposal to drop radio-active material into the Mediterranean between Corsica and St Raphael.

The family group then sat down for a late lunch before the father-in-law telephoned the police. Then again, Monsieur V, owing to family troubles, had written to the local paper and the superintendent of police, informing them that he was on the point of committing suicide, and gratefully leaving his house appurtenances and utensils to the superintendent.","Tuy aoatty oceurrtud fk Conely farm - howe.

Mart is unable to smell (her sense organs were impaired years ago), and I had to explain the low, sharp and sweet signals in the air. When we got back home we felt exhausted.

Mart had been right, the body had been a woman's. It belonged to a Madame N. Enquiries had been made in the neighbourhood, and it transpired that Madame N's husband had made an arrangement with the dead lady's sister to launch her into the strong sea and there be left to perish.","Oe werk te bea aw slept ul Ure hele -choves aAeurnriresl up Ue sum The neat momicg, is le square cpposile Pierre s, | rear about Ue Wice eee elec, ~—- Yr Paleicle.

r06-106.png,"The day I promised to take Catherine down to visit my young friend Philip at his school in the country, we were to leave at eleven, but she arrived at nine.

r06-111.png,"Catherine lives in a white house overlooking the sweeping brown tides of the river.

r06-115.png,"Catherine looked at the books lying around his room, and asked if she might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel to read on the train. Catherine is 13. I suggested she might find them difficult, but she said, 'Philip reads them, doesn't he?' During the journey I read newspapers and watched her pretty frowning face as she turned the pages of Babel, for she was determined to let nothing get between her and her ambition to be worthy of Philip.","Catheminre looker at Ue books Lying naaghat herrow,r Le sheries of came Oa tet eet oo 1 ets.

In Catherine's left hand she carried the stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we went to the pictures. Philip allowed it to be seen that he thought going to the pictures just for the fun of it was not worthy of intelligent people, but he made the concession, for our sakes.","AL Lie solo udich ie ol arnding , A viliseal aA erqrecive , He hoo clildver, walled logeler across greor~ felole, aot | follows, coring bors Us sir ares Ureav amg ht Peendey bce td btu, crcl, otter as Hew kedhaeh . bee ee cheries of lsrae Berbod .
